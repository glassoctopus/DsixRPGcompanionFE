## Getting Started
### D6 RPG Companion is a Fullstack Exercise that is teaching me about Django, React, Postman, and working with large amounts of data efficently. 
#### 1. Project Hosting (Next Steps)
The next step is to host this from my home lab, which is the focus of my upcoming project. Until then, you can clone both the frontend and backend repos and run them locally. I'm creating Postman requests (rather than fixtures) for loading canonical material into the database, so you can set this little RPG database toy up yourself:

#### 2. Project Purpose
This is designed to be a digital RPG companion for both players and game masters. The app includes:

 - Forms for creating and editing characters

 - Database CRUD API for greater flexability

 - A grouping tool for organizing players and GMs

Currently, the main focus is a D6 Star Wars character sheet (still in progress), along with group creation tools (roughed out).

## Getting Started
Note: In its current state, this project requires downloading both the frontend and backend repositories, setting them up locally, and running them together. So itâ€™s not plug-and-play... yet. But if youâ€™ve got them runningâ€¦

You can:

 - Create a Hero and manage their skill codes via a simple, living character sheet.

 - Group your characters with others (on your local machine ;^) into public groups. 
   
What This Also Is
 - A database manager for the D6 ruleset that a GM could use for managing their adventure party.

 - A tool with lots of stretch goals. Itâ€™s far from complete, but Iâ€™m committed to seeing it through.

 - Eventually, something Iâ€™ll host from my home lab (see you next yearâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰).

Vision and Motivation
This project is too ambitious for a one-month capstoneâ€”but Iâ€™m excited to keep building it as a learning tool for mastering React and Django. Once complete, I plan to revisit it with a new stack or at least a different backend to see how much I can improve with experience.

Hopes & Dreams
 - That this matures into a fully-fledged RPG companion.

 - That all forms and views reflect the core D6 game rules accurately.

 - That players can run full campaigns with living character sheets and GM-controlled permissions.

 - That it becomes more than just another throwaway school projectâ€”this is a tool I want to use, and itâ€™s grown into a labor of love.

I truly miss this system and would love to preserve it.
West End Games rocks!
