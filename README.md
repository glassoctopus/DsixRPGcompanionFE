## Getting Started
### D6 RPG Companion is a Fullstack Exercise that is teaching me about Django, React, Postman, and working with large amounts of data efficently. 
#### 1. The next step is to host this from my next project, my home lab. Until then, you could pull the front and back down, and I am creating Postman calls instead of fixtuers for canon material for the instantiation of the app, and set this little rpg database toy up yourself...

#### 2. This is to be a Player,Game Master digital rpg companion. So it's forms, database readers, and player gm grouping tool. 
Right now it is a D6 Starwwars Character Sheet. 

## Starting the Project
1. Make a Hero, & manage their skill codes, a living character sheet
2. Group them with other players and their characters, in public groups.  
   
What this also is;
1. A database manger for the D6 ruleset that a GameMaster could use for their adventure party.
2. Albeit we are a ton of stretch goals away form this now. But I plan on continuing this project till completion and setting up a home lab that I can host it from. (See you next year... ;^)
3. Too ambitious for a 1 month Capstone porject, but I am excited to see it through as a learning tool for the technologies involved. After completion, I want to take what i have learned to a new stack or at least backend, and see what i cannot do better the second time around.
4. -hopes and dreams, that this is a full fledge, working with the core game rules logic intact in all the forms, that users could use to play a d6 campagin, via the living character sheets.
5. -This is not meant to be a commerical product, but it aims to be more than a typical throw away school project. And a tool that i use to really master React and Django.
