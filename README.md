## Getting Started
### D6 RPG Companion is a Fullstack Exercise that is teaching me about Django, React, Postman, and working with large amounts of data efficently. 
#### 1. The next step is to host this from my next project, my home lab. Until then, you could pull the front and back down, and I am creating Postman calls instead of fixtuers for canon material for the instantiation of the app, and set this little rpg database toy up yourself...

#### 2. This is to be a Player,Game Master digital rpg companion. So it's forms, database readers, and player gm grouping tool. 
Right now it is a D6 Starwwars Character Sheet. 

## Starting the Project
1. Make a Hero, manage their; Archetype, skill codes, and Group them with other players and their characters.
