## Getting Started
### D6 RPG Companion is a Fullstack Exercise that is teaching me about Django, React, Postman, and working with large amounts of data efficently. 
#### 1. The next step is to host this from my next project, my home lab. Until then, you could pull the front and back down, and I am creating Postman calls instead of fixtuers for canon material for the instantiation of the app, and set this little rpg database toy up yourself...

#### 2. This is to be a Player, Game Master digital rpg companion. So it is forms, database readers, and player gm grouping tool. 
Right now it is a D6 Starwwars Character Sheet in progress, and grouping tool. 

## Starting the Project
(To be Fair in it's current state would take downloading and marrying the FE and BE repos and running it on your machine locally, so not the easiest of setups, but if you've done that...)
1. Make a Hero, & manage their skill codes, it's a simple living character sheet
2. You can also group your characters with other players (on your local machine ;^) and their characters, in public groups.  
   
What this also is;
1. A database manger for the D6 ruleset that a GameMaster could use for their adventure party.
2. Albeit we are a ton of stretch goals away form this now. But I plan on continuing this project till completion and setting up a home lab that I can host it from. (See you next year... ;^)
3. Too ambitious for a 1 month Capstone porject, but I am excited to see it through as a learning tool for the technologies involved. After completion, I want to take what I have learned to a new stack or at least backend, and see what I cannot do better the second time around.
4. -Hopes and Dreams, that this matuers into a full fledge RPG companion, working with the core game rules logic intact in all the forms, and views, etc., that users could use to play a d6 campagin, via the living character sheets, with a Game Master controlling the allowance of changes. 
5. -This is not meant to be a commerical product, but it aims to be more than a typical throw away school project. And a tool that I use to work towards mastering React and Django. It's grown into a labor of love now as I truly do miss this system and would love to preserve it. West End Games Rocks!
