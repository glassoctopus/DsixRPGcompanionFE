  Abednedo: 'The Abednedo are a common sentient species native to the planet of the same name. Abednedos are tall humanoids with mouth tendrils, long faces, and widely spaced fleshy nostrils; they often have a brown or tan skin color. Abednedos appearing in the Star Wars saga include Resistance pilots Ello Asty and C&quot;ai Threnalli.',
  Abyssin: 'The Abyssin inhabit the planet Byss. They are a nomadic race, often described as &quot;brutish and violent.&quot; They stand approximately two meters tall and have a humanoid appearance, with long limbs and weathered skin. They also possess a single large slit-pupiled eye which dominates their greenish-tan foreheads. Abyssins do not take kindly to derogatory nicknames regarding their eye, such as &quot;monoc,&quot; &quot;one-eye,&quot; or &quot;cyclops.&quot; They are quick to anger, especially when taunted or insulted. They are known to look for conflict and rarely show restraint. All Abyssins have the ability to heal quickly and to regenerate body parts, which leads to their belief that change is impossible, and as such they rarely stray from their home world. Abyssins dislike blaster fire and space-battles.',
  Aleena: 'The Aleena are a short-bodied alien race native to the planet Aleen. They are characterized by their thick bodies and short limbs. They waddle when they walk, and are ungainly to look upon. Their heads are dominated by a long, thin plate of body which extends back from the skull, and their faces are flat. Two little eyes sit over a wide mouth which is filled with short, sharp teeth. Individuals are bred for their color variation, another way they avoid becoming prey. As a people, the Aleena have a strong warrior tradition. They possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allows them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators (such as sagcatchers) on their harsh home planet.',
  Amani: 'The Amani are large, mainly arboreal aliens descended from planarian worms. They have long arms and a broad body, and their heads resemble that of a hooded cobra, but with a humanoid face. They hail from Maridun, where they prefer to travel in the trees, using their arms to swing among branches, but their shapes also allow them to curl into a ball and roll at incredible speeds. They organize into small, technologically primitive tribes that form war parties to fight the other tribes for territory. They have a cultural aversion to advanced technology introduced by the &apos;off-worlder&apos; or greater outside galactic civilization, and they generally prefer to fight with traditional spears and arrows. They are also popular as guards and bodyguards with the criminal elements of the galaxy. The Hutts are the biggest users of their services. An Amanin can be seen briefly in Return of the Jedi. This alien serves as one of Jabba&apos;s guards in his palace and can be seen guarding one of Jabba&apos;s most prized possessions: Han Solo encased in carbonite. He is yellow with brown/green stripes and carries a long spear decorated with severed humanoid heads.',
  Amaran: 'Amarans are fox-like sentients from the planet Amar which are heavily involved in the animal trade.',
  Annoo_dat_Prime: 'The Annoo dat Prime is a four-eyed, reptilian race hailing from the planet Annoo. The average height for an Annoo dat Prime is 8 feet (2.4 m). They tend to have rough, yellow scaled skin, with a small row of spines running down their backs and to the end of their short tails. They have four eyes, the upper two red and the lower two blue. The only Annoo dat Prime to ever be named or shown in expanded universe was the separatist General Ashaar Khorda. He appears in the Zam Wessel comic book, and subsequently dies following a plot to destroy Coruscant.',
  Anomid: 'Anomid are humanoid, with gray hair and silver-blue eyes, and are native to the Yablari system. They communicate largely by using their own sign language. Boba Fett impersonated one in Rebel Dawn, part of the Han Solo trilogy of books. They are reportedly one of the more social species in the Star Wars galaxy.',
  Ansionian: 'Ansionians are tall and thin. In addition to possessing a single nostril, they have relatively large eyes. The Ansionians hail from the planet of Ansion, and are known to be lovers of peace. Many Ansionians, called Alwari, live in tribal factions on the plains, away from the human settler-created cities. They are relatively nomadic and resent technology and the fact that it has ruined the face of their planet, but not to such an extent so as to cause violence.',
  Anzati: 'These aliens appear similar to humans, the only differences being two prehensile probosci and a somewhat enlarged nose and surrounding facial structure. People of their species are rare, but they have a lifespan that can last for over a millennium. They tend to behave like vampires. The proboscises lie coiled and hidden in pockets within the cheeks and can be extended to drain a victim&apos;s &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;soup&quot; by piercing the brain through the nose. The Anzati are capable of mild telepathic control to render their victims paralyzed, and are assassins of legendary skill. The Jedi hunting mercenary Aurra Sing was trained by these assassins, as was the Jedi Master Tholme. Their planet of origin has never been verified, as all sent to investigate the planet suspected to be Anzat are never seen again. Two more famous Anzati were Dannik Jerriko, an assassin of great renown who hunted Han Solo, as written in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. (Dannik Jerriko appears in person and actually demonstrates killing someone in Galaxy of Fear: Ghost of the Jedi) and the dark Jedi Nikkos Tyris.',
  Aqualish: 'The most notorious of the Aqualish, Ponda Baba, suffered a severed arm at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi during a fight in the Mos Eisley cantina. The species has a reputation for being nasty, crude and aggressive, and generally pursue careers as mercenaries, bounty hunters and pirates. The Aqualish are divided into three different subspecies, the Aquala, the Ualaq and the Quara; these subspecies are differentiated by their hand structure (The Aqualish hail from the planet Ando. Their home planet is almost entirely covered by water; the only hospitable land consists of a few rocky outcroppings and swamp-covered islands. Aqualish flesh does not cauterize, nor does their blood coagulate, when wounded by a lightsaber. This can be seen in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Aqualish also have the tendencies to involve themselves in the spice trade.',
  Arcona: 'Arcona are scale-less, reptilian humanoids. They have flat, anvil-shaped heads, with clear, marble-like eyes, and skin tone that ranges from mahogany to ebony. The Arcona&quot;s weaknesses have been exploited in the past; off-worlders used to trade water for mineral rights, but discovered their easy addiction to salt. Traders then imported large amounts of the mineral before communities outlawed the dealings. When the species has become addicted to salt, their eyes turn from green to gold. To survive an Arconan must periodically consume a substance known as dactyl. Salt increases an Arconan&apos;s need for this substance by a hundredfold. A well known Arcona was the Jedi Knight Izal Waz (Troy Denning&apos;s Star Wars: The New Jedi Order - Star By Star).',
  Argazdan: 'Argazdans were a green-skinned humanoid species native to the planet Argazda. One individual named Raygar was first featured in the Ewoks episode &quot;Battle for the Sunstar&quot;.',
  Aruzan: 'Aruzans, the inhabitants of Aruza, are humanoids with faintly blue skin and dark, nearly black hair. They have the ability to share their memories and emotions with one another by means of cybernetic implants. During the time of Imperial subjugation, the Aruzans hired Dengar to assassinate General Kritkeen, who was the planetary commander.',
  Askajian: 'These near-human aliens appear to be bulky, flabby creatures and are often dismissed as such. The bulk is actually stored water, a genetic trait acquired from evolving on a desert planet. When needed, the Askajian can draw on this water to survive, in which case they become dramatically thinner as the stored water is used up. Askajian tend to have multiple children per pregnancy, and thus as an evolutionary trait females of the species have three sets of breasts. Jabba the Hutt had an Askajian dancer in his palace on Tatooine, whom he kept at near-maximum water weight as he found her bulk attractive.',
  Azumel: 'Azumels are a species that has gray, mottled brown, or tan colored skin. They also have six eyestalks. They made an appearance in Solo: A Star Wars Story.',
  Balosar: 'Balosars are a sentient humanoid species from the world Basolar, which is a ruined planet, located in the Core Worlds section of the galaxy. Balosars appear to be sickly compared to common galactic species due to the heavy pollution of the Balosar homeworld. They have pale skin, dark eyes, and are thin and spindly. They have been afflicted with a debilitating disease due to the polluted environment. An example of an individual from this species is the Balosar pirate Boba Fett, a smuggler.',
  Barabel: 'Barabels are a species of humanoid reptiles with scaly skin and red or green skin tones. They have a more primitive culture but are respected for their skills as warriors. They have claws and sharp teeth, and are well-known for their aggressive and combative nature. They are heavily involved in criminal activities and bounty hunting.',
  Besalisk: 'Besalisks are a race of four-armed humanoids from the icy planet of Ojom, though female Besalisks can have up to eight arms. Besalisks evolved from large flightless avians, though they are often mistaken for a reptilian species. They are bulky, fleshy beings able to survive for long periods without food or water. They tend to have a bony crest surrounded by short feathers, and a wide mouth with an elastic sack dangling from it. Because of their size, they are often seen as gluttonous, though this is a misconception. Another misconception is that they are nervous or in poor shape because they sweat profusely, though this is in fact due to the normally freezing temperatures on their home planet. The average Besalisk stands approximately 1.8 meters tall. Their language consists of grunts, growls, and barks, and their written language has a simple alphabet and short words, although Besalisks can speak Galactic Basic with ease. Although Besalisks have contributed very little to the galaxy in terms of resources and technology, they are sociable, gregarious, and keen-witted, are found easily in the galactic community and can readily use what other species have to offer. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Besalisks narrowly avoided slavery by calling in favors with various influential underworld connections. Many are still working off their freedom, especially besalisks that were foolish or desperate enough to seek aid from the Hutts. Besalisks have never sought official representation in the Galactic Senate and generally seem content to go about their business and leave Galactic affairs to politicians and bureaucrats of other species. Communities on their homeworld are sparsely populated, and few offworld colonies of Besalisks are found in any era. One Besalisk, Dexter Jettster, a good friend of Obi-Wan Kenobi, is seen in Attack of the Clones. Dexter helped Kenobi by telling him where a poisoned dart had come from, eventually leading to the discovery of the clone army on Kamino. Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell served during the Clone Wars. In combat, he would take advantage of his six-limbed anatomy by wielding two double-bladed lightsabers, often to devastating effect. Pong Krell turned on his clone troopers in the battle of Umbara, sending them unknowingly to kill other clone troopers. His plan was to prove to count Dooku that he was ready to join him.',
  Bith: 'Bith are native to the planet Clak&quot;Dor VII. They have pale skin, large heads and eyes, and long fingers. Their mouths are hidden within three folds of moist skin, and their ears are capable of hearing frequencies far beyond those that most species can perceive. In some cases, Bith have been known to hear high-powered communication broadcast signals without using artificial equipment. Due to their highly tuned audio senses, Bith are often sought after as musicians across the galaxy. They also have great reputations as starship mechanics and scientists. Figrin D&apos;an and the Modal Nodes are a Bith band seen playing music in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Bith are also able to store large amounts of information in a very short period of time and retain that information in an undamaged binary state for short periods of time. They are considered mature at ten years of age and are known for long life.',
  Blarina: 'The Blarina are an alien race introduced in the 2015 novelization of Star Wars: The Force Awakens by Alan Dean Foster.[12] In the novel, X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron, stranded on the desert planet Jakku, is aided by the Blarina scavenger Naka Iit.[12] Naka is described as being humanoid but scaly, a little more than half the height of a human, with a short, wide snout and gold-hued, slitted eyes.[12] He has claws and sharp teeth, and more teeth than humans have.[12] Poe notes that the Blarina are &quot;not especially strong, but ... very, very quick&quot;. Naka also mentions a Blarina merchant named Ohn Gos in the Jakku settlement of Blowback Town.[12]',
  Blood_Carver: 'Blood Carvers are thin humanoids, golden in skin color, with three jointed arms and legs. Their nose is two separate flaps that contain both the senses of smell and of hearing.\n\nTheir society hates the idea of wealth and money and sees little to no use for it, basing their hierarchy on honor rather than money.[13]',
  Boltrunian: 'Boltrunians are a large and muscular reptilian near-human species with hairless heads, craggy faces, wide noses, and heavy brow ridges. Boltrunians could live to be over 700 years old. Well-known Boltrunians included Warto and the Dark Jedi Maw. Often, a Boltrunian would be mistaken for a Trandoshan.',
  B$omarr_monks: 'The B&#x27;omarr are not actually a species&amp;#59; rather they were an order of monks whose monastery eventually became Jabba&#x27;s Palace. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment and to that end undergo surgery to separate their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They learn to communicate telepathically and by controlling technology attuned to their abilities. On the rare occasions when they need to move, they are able to use a spider-like walking apparatus. The B&#x27;omarr were still in Jabba&#x27;s Palace at the time it appears in Return of the Jedi&amp;#44; and indeed&amp;#44; as C-3PO enters Jabba&#x27;s palace&amp;#44; a spiderwalker can be seen. The monks inhabit the lower part of the palace and allow the various smugglers and crime lords like Jabba to use the upper levels&amp;#44; as long as they add another section to the lower levels for use by the B&#x27;omarr. When the current ruler of the upper levels is deposed they drive out the stragglers and add the brains of those who do not leave to their order. The infamous Bib Fortuna himself eventually (unwillingly) became a monk&amp;#44; as he had sought power through the monks&#x27; teachings&amp;#91;14&amp;#93;. The animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; establishes that the B&#x27;omarr order maintained monasteries on several planets. The facility on Teth&amp;#44; built on the top of a steep mountain&amp;#44; served as the hideout for Separatist forces who kidnapped Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s son Rotta. The architecture was very similar to Jabba&#x27;s palace. According to dialogue in the film&amp;#44; many of the abandoned monasteries are used as hideouts for smugglers.',
  Bothan: 'In Star Wars Legends, Bothans hail from the industrial Mid Rim planet of Bothawui, though they also populate various colony worlds like Kothlis and Torolis. Most Bothans stand about 5&ndash;6 ft. tall. They have tapered pointed ears, elongated heads, and a very few from both sexes have beards. They are manipulative, crafty, suspicious, curious by nature, loyal, brave, and very smart. They developed their technology to travel among the stars millennia ago and are longstanding members of the galactic civilization. The Bothans, in the galactic war, play the role of spies for the Rebel Alliance. To the Bothans, information is the galaxy&apos;s most valuable currency, as well as its most potent weapon. As a culture, they believe that direct confrontation with foes — whether economic, political, or martial — is pointless. In an open conflict, the object both sides desire is often damaged or destroyed. This attitude has made espionage a natural line of work for Bothans. Information and spies are their greatest exports. The famed Bothan spynet is the largest independent intelligence-gathering organization the galaxy has ever seen. Beings of power everywhere find Bothans irritating because they have a tendency to use every bit of information they can to acquire leverage or money, but no one wants to be the only person without access to the spynet, so everyone continues to deal with the Bothans. The most renowned Bothans from Chaos Squadron are Jorec Thebe, Giddic Ryne and Relluf Xander, the three surviving Bothans who provided the Death Star plans in Return of the Jedi. Another Bothan is Borsk Fey$lya, who later became leader of the New Republic and sacrificed himself during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Fey$lya led a campaign against Admiral Ackbar in the Thrawn books. In canon, the only mention of Bothans are by Mon Mothma in Return of the Jedi. Many Bothans died to bring the rebellion information about the Death Star II in Return of the Jedi.',
  Bouncer: 'Bouncers are furry green floating orbs with thin black tails that live on the planet Ruusan. They also appear in the novels and audio dramatizations of Star Wars: Dark Forces upon the planet Sulon. Morgan Katarn, father of soon-to-be Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, discovers the creatures in the Valley of the Jedi in Ruusan, naming them appropriately. Bouncers apparently move with the wind, lifting flaps of skin to use them as sails to guide their bodies. They use rocks and other formations to bounce them high, gliding them through the air for travel. Bouncers are said to be attuned with the Force and can communicate with those who can manipulate it. They can also become hostile when exposed to massive amounts of energy from the dark side of the Force, such as Lord Kaan&apos;s thought bomb. They communicate with other species by speaking into their minds. They can attempt to predict the future.',
  Caamasi: 'The Caamasi are a species of golden-furred humanoids known for their calm wisdom and pacifist nature. Strongly loyal to the Old Republic, many Caamasi died when their homeworld of Caamas was devastated by the Galactic Empire.',
  Cathar: 'The Cathar are cat-like humanoids from the planet Cathar. Famous Cathar are the Jedi Juhani and Crado and Sylvar, pupils of the ancient Jedi Master Vodo Siosk-Baas. The party member character Juhani from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic belongs to the Cathar race (though she&apos;s actually part of a subspecies of the Cathar that was notable for appearing less catlike than the baseline Cathar species). Aric Jorgan, a companion character to the Trooper class in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, is also a member of the Cathar species. This race is also now playable in game.',
  Celegian: 'The Celegians are a species of intelligent scyphozoans native to Celegia, appearing as floating brains trailing a cluster of prehensile tentacles. The species are renowned for their wisdom and intellect, and they often travel far seeking to expand their knowledge. Celegians evolved from ocean-dwelling ancestors, and developed a natural form of levitation similar to an organic repulsorlift generator. Their homeworld has a cyanogen atmosphere, which is lethal to most species but necessary for the Celegains, for whom oxygen is toxic. Because of this, when they travel offworld, they are normally encased in a chamber filled with cyanogen; this causes them to appear as if afloat in a watery brine. Because of their fragile form and life support requirements, they are rarely encountered.',
  Cerean: 'Cereans are a species with long cone-like heads (because they have an extra heart on top of their brain) that hail from the planet Cerea. One example is Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. They have a very low number of males compared to females, therefore Master Mundi was allowed to have one bond wife (Shea) and several honor wives even though he was a Jedi. Cereans sport binary brains within their large heads, and although their coordination is generally somewhat impaired relative to humans or other species, they make up for it with incredible mind control and thought processes.',
  Chadra_Fan: 'The Chadra-Fan are short, furry mammalianoids with bat-like faces and flap-like ears. A famous Chadra-Fan was Tekli of the New Jedi Order, who later became a healer for the Jedi. Her race was often received well because they had what many Star Wars authors referred to as adorable features.',
  Chalactan: 'The Chalactans are a near-human race native to Chalacta. One example is Depa Billaba.',
  Chagrian: 'Chagrians are blue skinned humanoids with horns and lethorns. One example is Mas Amedda, who is the Speaker of the Galactic Senate. The Chagrian homeworld&apos;s twin suns produce vast amounts of radiation that would kill a normal human. Chagrians evolved their blue skins to filter the radiation.',
  Chikarri: 'A Chikarri was a seldom-seen squirrel-like sentient from the planet Plagen. Like real squirrels, they were good climbers. They were known to be fascinated with technology, though they took care to make sure none harmed their homeworld.',
  Chironian: 'The Chironian were a centaur-like race from Chiron. The only known character of this species is Lusa, a force-sensitive introduced in the novel The Crystal Star. They&apos;ve been known to express their emotions by the movement of their legs (stomping when impatient, tapping when excited).',
  Chiss: 'In the Star Wars universe, the Chiss are a humanoid species with pale blue skin, blue-black hair, and glowing red eyes, their native language is Cheunh. First introduced to the Star Wars expanded universe in Timothy Zahn&apos;s Thrawn trilogy through his arch villain Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Chiss have since developed into a popular species amongst fans and other Expanded Universe authors. Another notable Chiss was Sev&apos;rance Tann, a Dark Acolyte serving Count Dooku and a general in the Armed Forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems (believed to have actually preceded General Grievous as Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies). In the Expanded Universe, Csilla is identified as the homeworld of the Chiss. Csilla is a cold world of glaciers and snowy wastes located deep within Chiss Space, and serves as the capital of the Chiss Empire. The Chiss are noted for their lack of reliance on droids, or any kind of artificial intelligence. Baron Soontir Fel attempted to change this during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, by introducing self-thinking spacecraft. Any progress on this is more or less unknown. While their history has been marked by nearly continual warfare and conquest of other worlds, the Chiss are generally not personally violent: indeed, one of the major laws of their society (the breaking of which resulted in Thrawn&apos;s exile from their space) is that the Chiss cannot launch preemptive attacks, even against obvious aggressors. Chiss are a playable species in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Noted for their typical alliance to the Empire, they can initially be Agents or Bounty Hunters and unlocked to be played as a Republic class. They are primarily Imperial Agents as in game characters and stationed on the ice planets of Hoth and Illum.',
  Chistori: 'The Chistori are a lizard like humanoid race. They resemble bipedal lizards with a prominent muzzle, an impressive line of teeth, and thick scales. Few things are known in connection with the reptilians known as the Chistori because they are a secretive race. Even the Jedi Files do not know their native world. Due to their reptilian nature, they are cold blooded. If a Chistori is exposed to cold temperatures for a prolonged period of time they will undoubtedly die. One example of a Chistori would be Desann.',
  Clawdite: 'Clawdites are a genetic offspring of the Zolanders, the dominant species on planet Zolan. When the Zolanders discovered that their Moon had increased its radioactive emissions, they tried to unleash a gene in the Clawdites skin cells to activate natural protection against radiation. The results created a new species, Clawdites, which were metamorphs. Clawdites can change their appearance, if keeping body mass as a constant and not retaining the same aspect for a long time. The Clawdites then joined the Sith Empire as part of Darth Sidious&quot; plot. Their stealthy and stealthy qualities made them useful in the Jedi Order&apos;s covert operations and intelligence gathering. The most famous Clawdite was Zam Wesell. Clawdites were used in the Star Wars expanded universe for their versatile infiltration capabilities.',
  CodruJi: 'Codru-Ji are four-armed humanoids with pointed ears who, while not xenophobic in the typical sense, have not yet integrated themselves into galactic society. They guard their society and their young with equal ferocity, which can be surprising since an immature Codru-Ji appears almost nothing like a mature Codru-Ji, and in fact can be mistaken for a pet. Immature Codru-Ji, also known as Wyrwulf, are small, six-limbed lupine creatures who enter a chrysalis phase in puberty and emerge a mature Codru-Ji.',
  Colicoid: 'Colicoids are a bug-like race from Colla IV. They are the inventors of the destroyer droid and they themselves can also curl up and roll around. They tended to be both ruthless and greedy in terms of personality.',
  Coway: 'The Coway appear in the 1978 novel Splinter of the Mind&apos;s Eye, by Alan Dean Foster. The Coway are a fur-covered humanoid species that are native to the planet Mimban, of the Circarpous Major system. Coways live deep underground, and have a strong aversion to surface-dwellers. Coways have small eyes, but are able to see in the dark due to their infrared vision. Additionally, they are able to eat foods normally poisonous to humans because of their more tolerant digestive system. They wear simple, primitive clothing. The underground world of the Coway can be reached through deep shafts known as Thrella Shafts (named after the Thrella, an extinct species known for their numerous tunnels and wells). Often these have side-tunnels that lead to Coway dwellings. The tribal government of the Coway consists of a triumvirate who make the major decisions for the tribe.',
  Cragmoloid: 'The Cragmoloids are a race of elephant-like people from the planet Ankus who are often hunted for their ivory, and consider removing their tusks a form of embarrassment. They are short-tempered, direct, proud and social, and hate being alone.',
  Dashade: 'In the new Jedi Order books, the Dashade people are almost exterminated by the Yuuzhan Vong; but Anakin Solo steps in, and saves one particular tribe before beginning a terrible journey back to the main settlement whilst being pursued by Yuuzhan Vong warriors. Another famous Dashade is Khem Val, a companion character for the Sith Inquisitor in Star Wars: The Old Republic.',
  Defel: 'The Defel were introduced through the presence of Arleil Schous in the Mos Eisley cantina of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.',
  Devaronian: 'Devaronians were one of the first species in the galaxy to develop interstellar travel, and the males of the species have been common sights in spaceports throughout the galaxy for thousands of years. A distinguishing physical feature of Devaronians are the devil-like horns emerging from the tops of their heads. Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another. As such, they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, and, as such, raise the young and run the government of Devaron. The males send as much money as they can manage back to their home world to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return once they have begun to travel the stars. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. One Devaronian, Kardue&apos;sai&apos;Malloc (going by the name of Labria) was seen smiling and seated at the bar in the cantina scene of A New Hope. He had one of the galaxy&apos;s highest bounties posted by the Rebel Alliance for his war crimes at the Devaronian city of Montellian Serat, and was eventually captured by Boba Fett. Unlike most Devaronian males, Labria had a rare mutation that gave him two sets of teeth, a normal male set and a female set that he could retract at will. Such mutants were prized as scouts, as they could travel afar and survive on food normally inedible to males. Another notable Devaronian is Vizago from the Star Wars television series, Rebels. Vizago is the captain of the Broken Horn.',
  Dowutin: 'Dowutins are an alien species featured in legends and other films. They have horns on their chins and have hooved feet. They are usually very large. Examples include: Grummgar the Hunter, who is seen in Maz Kanata&apos;s castle in The Force Awakens, and the Ninth Sister, who is an Inquisitor featured in Star Wars comics and in the Star Wars: Jedi video game series.',
  DrachNam: 'Drach&apos;nam appear in the short story &quot;Jade Solitare&quot; in the compilation Tales from the New Republic. They are a very brutal and violent race employing neuronic whips (a whip with a conductive lash which sends hundreds of volts through the victim&apos;s body), and long, 15 inch, serrated knives. Their home planet is very diverse on the surface ranging from very hot to extremely cold. The planet rotates extremely slowly - one day is about two hundred earth years - so as a result all of the Drach&apos;nam cities are dark and dank tunnels. The only famous Drach&apos;nam is Chay Praysh, who is famous for employing female slaves in his palace. Mara Jade once became a slave to his brutal regime to rescue Ja Bardrins daughter Sansia.',
  Dressellian: 'Dressellians are wrinkled humanoids from the planet Dressel. Dressellians believe fiercely in an individual&apos;s freedom and will often find it difficult to work in groups, even so many formed a freedom fighting force during the time of the Empire to fight for their right to live as they wanted. Dressellians treasure freedom above everything else. Dressellians use slugthrowers (rifles and pistols firing metal projectiles) instead of blasters. Several Dressellians appear briefly on screen in Return of the Jedi, attending the Rebel Alliance meeting on board the Home One star cruiser, just prior to the Battle of Endor. An action figure of a Dressellian dubbed &quot;Prune Face&quot; was produced for Kenner&apos;s Star Wars action figure line in 1984.',
  Droch: 'Source of the mysterious Death Seed plague, the drochs are an insect race from Nam Chorios that start off life as non-sentient but can become sentient by absorbing the life of victims. A droch can burrow under the skin of its intended victim and drink their life while they sleep, or sometimes while they are awake. Their small size, great agility and fast reproductive cycle means that they can wipe out the population of a city in a matter of only a few days. As the drochs drink of sentient victim&apos;s life, they also absorb intelligence. Larger, &quot;captain drochs&quot; can absorb life through the smaller drochs without having to come into contact with the victims themselves. One mutated captain droch, named Dzym, lived to be 250 years old and grew to human size, able to disguise himself as a human and gaining sentience from absorbing intelligence for all that time.',
  Drovian: 'Drovians are a tall and burly species from Nim Drovis with thick trunk-like legs that, like their arms, end in three sharp pincers. The Drovians divided into two tribes, the Gopsoa&apos;o and the Drovians, centuries ago, and have been at war with each other since. Nearly all Drovians are addicted to a narcotic called zwil; originally imported as a cake flavoring, the Drovians can absorb it directly into their systems through their breathing tubes.',
  Dug: 'Dugs are shown in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter as an enemy on the planet Malastare. Dugs have been known to be greedy, and are most of the time looking for a deal on any product. In Attack of the Clones a Dug is seen in one of the airspeeders during the speeder chase sequence and another is seen in Dexter&apos;s diner. One infamous Dug is the Tatooine bully Sebulba. He is Anakin&apos;s main competitor in the pod race on Tatooine in The Phantom Menace. More dugs can be seen in the Star Wars TV show, Clone Wars.',
  Dulok: 'Duloks are a green-colored furry species of Endor and are biologically related to Ewoks, though they tend to act more like Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. They first appeared in the Ewoks series, and one makes an appearance on Coruscant in Clone Wars.',
  Duros: 'Duros are hairless beings with blue skin and large red eyes, said to be among the first spacefaring humanoid species, including humans. They are known for their superior astronavigational skills. Their homeworld is Duro, which is in the galactic core. Two Duros can be seen in the Mos Eisley Cantina in the 1977 film Star Wars. Cad Bane, a Duro on the Cartoon Network show The Clone Wars, is a professional bounty hunter. Duros have also appeared in a few Star Wars games, including Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. The Duros have not set foot on their world since the Empire polluted it with weapons factories. Instead they live in large orbital cities surrounding the planet. Duros are related to the Neimoidians, the aliens in charge of the Trade Federation in the prequel films, because many years before the Republic, the Duros colonized the planet Neimoidia, and thus the Neimoidians, a newer &quot;version&quot; of Duros, were born. Ironically the two races differed in temperament: Duros were normally seen as adventurous, while Neimoidians were mostly skittish. The Duros consider the Neimoidians to be cowardly and take offense at being mistaken by other beings for a Neimoidian. Duros are also known for their great story-telling skills because of the many places that they have visited during their travels throughout the galaxy: their preferred form of address is &quot;Traveller&quot;, as shown in The Paradise Snare. Their planet was remade by the Yuuzhan Vong during the war into a bio-shipyard for the Vong&apos;s living creations.',
  Echani: 'The Echani are a mysterious race of well taught fighters, whose most prominent appearance was in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. Five Echani Handmaiden sisters reside with Jedi Master Atris at her academy at the polar ice cap on Telos IV. These Echani were trained by Atris to construct barriers in their minds in order to resist Force-based powers. The Echani race possess natural martial art skill and wear light armor in battle, although they prefer to wear very little when training to restrict their movements less. The Echani maidens were often used to hunt down rogue Jedi and subdue them for the Order. Human in appearance, they often have leucistic skin and hair and closely resemble their parents, and therefore their siblings. As long as they have the same parents, Echani siblings are identical in appearance. The best known of the Echani in the Star Wars universe was Brianna, the last of Atris&apos; Handmaidens. She served with her Mistress on Telos IV, until the Jedi Exile arrived. After speaking with the Exile, she stowed away on board his ship, the Ebon Hawk. Eventually, it is revealed that her mother was a Jedi Knight and she herself starts on the path of the Jedi. This fact is the reason that Brianna looks different from her sisters - she does not share the same mother. This story depended on the player of the game choosing a male character. If the player chose a female character, the above story would not occur as so. It is known that the Echani held a traditional rivalry with the Mandalorians. Echani and Mandalorians both saw each other as worthy opponents, therefore causing a war between them to prove whose skills were the better. Due to the combat training of the Echani on a daily level, their bones become tougher, making them more durable. A version of the Echani style of unarmed combat is taught to members of Palpatine&apos;s Imperial Guard and Sith guard. This style has been adapted to be more brutal and efficient and less flashy. Echani were often seen on snowy/cold planets such as Hoth and Eshan. They made their bases underground since they would have been made out of durable materials. Though not much is known about their aging process it is presumed that they age at the same rate of a human and their life expectancy is around one hundred years.',
  Elomin: 'The Elomin are tall, demon-like thin humanoids with pointed ears and four horns. They live on the surface of the planet Elom. As a society, the Elomin strove to find order in all things, and worked to create order where it didn&apos;t exist. So when they discovered that another species, the Eloms, shared the same planet with them, most Elomin refused to acknowledge that their underground brethren even existed.',
  Epicanthix: 'The Epicanthix are tall, muscular, near-humans native to the planet Panatha. They were known as warriors, having conquered many bordering planets such as Bunduki. They live longer than humans, with a life-span of around 130 years. They possess a rare genetic immunity to Force assisted mental tricks, influence, domination and mind reading. Although Epicanthix appeared very similar to baseline human, they were distinct enough that they could be recognized by sight, as in the case of Epicanthix Imperial Agent Ula Vii, who was so recognized by a pair of Imperials and ridiculed for his non-Human ancestry.',
  Er_Kit: 'Er&apos;Kit are usually skinny and grayish-blue, with long ears. The only well-known one is Ody Mandrell. Er&apos;Kit inhabit the desert planet Er&apos;Kit, for which they were named. One can be seen in The Phantom Menace during the pod race.',
  Evocii: 'The Evocii are a primitive humanoid race from Nal Hutta, formerly known as Evocar.',
  Ewok: 'Ewoks are a primitive tribal species from the forest moon of Endor. They are approximately half the size of humans and covered with fur. The Ewoks are best known for their aid to the Rebel mission to remove the deflector shield protecting the Second Death Star known as the battle of Endor. Some would humorously argue that the Ewoks are responsible for the downfall of the Empire, because without them, the Rebel fleet would have been completely destroyed. While peaceful by nature, they are extremely territorial and have been known to fight ferociously in protection of their society. Though they are known as Ewoks, the species name itself was never mentioned in Return of the Jedi. They can also be found in the Lucasfilm movie Caravan of Courage and The Battle of Endor.',
  Falleen: 'The Falleen are a race of human-like reptilian people originating from the world Falleen in the Mid Rim region within the Star Wars universe. They have the ability to change the hue of their skin to convey their emotional state and influence the emotional state of others. Both males and females of this race emit strong pheromones, easily attracting members of other humanoid species, irrespective of gender. Black Sun, a crime syndicate within the Mid Rim, was run by Falleen noblemen. A notable Legends villain from this race is Prince Xizor. Another major villain was Darth Karrid of the Old Republic.',
  Far_Outsiders: 'Far-Outsiders is the cryptic code-name given by the Chiss who inhabit the edges of the galaxy (an example of one being Grand Admiral Thrawn of the Empire), for the extra-galactic alien force that began assaulting the Unknown Regions in the years during the Galactic Civil War. They are probably the Yuuzhan Vong, who launched a siege on the galaxy from 25 to 30 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin). The name &quot;Far-Outsiders&quot; is also used by the inhabitants of Zonama Sekot to describe the invaders that attacked their planet. The Far-Outsiders are referred to in the singular, but the Chiss named &quot;Stent&quot; once told Mara Jade that there were &quot;a hundred different threats out there that would freeze your blood if you knew about them. The Ruling Families can&apos;t stop them; neither can any power in the region.&quot;, suggesting that the term &quot;Far-Outsiders&quot; may apply to any unknown hostile race originating from outside the galaxy.',
  Feeorin: 'Nym, a pirate from various Star Wars computer games (including the MMORPG &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;) was a Feeorin. It is said that Feeorins only grow stronger with age. Their homeworld was Odryn for a period of time in the Old Republic era when the oldest and strongest Feeorin was chosen as their leader. The controversial Jedi master Feln was a Feeorin leader. It has been stated in several Star Wars novels and comics that there are only roughly one million Feeorins left in the galaxy, suggesting a decline from a larger number.',
  Ferroans: 'Not a well-known species, the only references to Ferroans appear in Force Heretic 1&ndash;3 and Rogue Planet. They have icy blue skin, white-toned hair, and live on Zonama Sekot, a living planet. The planet provides them with fleshy habitats constructed of its own mass.',
  Firrerreo: 'The Firrerreo are a species of near-humans from the planet Firrerre. They have two-toned hair and golden skin. In their culture, if someone says a Firrerreo&apos;s name, the Firrerreo would be forced to serve the speaker, as saying a Firrerreo&apos;s name was a form of power. They no longer live on Firrerre; after the poisoning of their world by the Empire, they were loaded onto massive colony ships for a journey to another world. One of their own, a Force-sensitive named Hethrir, betrayed his people at the command of Darth Vader. After the deaths of Darth Vader and Palpatine, Hethrir returned and intercepted the colony ships. He disengaged the drives and left the sleeping Firrerre to drift in space. He plundered the ships for the valuable equipment on board and took the children to sell as slaves. Hethrir kidnapped the children of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa Solo; Anakin and the twins Jacen and Jaina. Han was on a mission at the time and did not know of the kidnappings, so Princess Leia set out to find them herself. On her quest, she stumbled upon the drifting colony ships. She asked one of the two awake Firrerre if he wanted to be freed, but he said that they would reengage the drive, heading towards the planet selected for them by the Emperor years before. They were considered extinct by the Yuuzhan Vong War, but, 15 years later, they were just considered scattered.',
  Fosh: 'The Fosh are a sentient avian species. They are first mentioned in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. The only Fosh mentioned in all the Star Wars books was the Jedi Knight Vergere. The Fosh never had a large population on their planet, which prevented them from becoming as influential a race as humans are in the Star Wars universe. Fosh females have preternaturally developed tear ducts, used for mating purposes on their homeworld. The Jedi Vergere, with the aid of the Force, can further alter her tears to secrete anything from an extremely potent anesthetic to a powerful antidote such as the one that cured Mara Jade Skywalker after she was infected with a deadly Yuuzhan Vong disease. The only known Fosh, a female Jedi Knight named Vergere, is also mentioned during Anakin Skywalker&apos;s time on Zonoma Sekot, as he recalls a flashback of her. Her call is what brought Obi-Wan and Anakin to the planet in the first place, although they can find no trace of her, and instead hear of mysterious invaders. The description of Vergere falls in line with the description of her when she returns with the Yuuzhan Vong, and is the same Vergere that disappeared from Zonoma Sekot.',
  Gamorrean: 'A Gamorrean is a large pig-like humanoid. The creatures have little intelligence and are often hired as guards, notably by Jabba the Hutt, who was fond of hiring them due to their low cost. On their home planet, Gamorreans exist in a sort of tribal political system dominated by the female sows. The males train for massive tribal conflicts that take place each year. The first time a space ship landed on Gamorr, the various tribes fought for days over who would win the right to approach it. The winning side eventually battered the vessel to pieces. Entries regarding the Gamorrean homeworld in travel guides simply read &quot;DO NOT GO TO GAMORR!&quot; Physically, Gamorreans appear in Return of the Jedi as greenish, slimy (and apparently smelly) pig-like creatures. They are about 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) tall and weigh about 100 kilograms (220 lb). Underneath their pig-like snouts, protruding from jowled cheeks, are yellowed tusks. These complement the small, yellow horns the Gamorreans have growing from the top of their heads. These creatures appear in a picture released by the creator of the show The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau, to promote the release of season 2 of the show coming out in fall of 2020. A few Gammoreans also feature prominently in The Book of Boba Fett. Howard Stern has referred frequently to &quot;Gamorrean Guard&quot;, a person interviewed by Gary Garver at a Star Wars convention.',
  Gand: 'Gands are insectoids who evolved on the planet Gand. There are two main sub-species of Gands: those with lungs, which are very rare, and those without. Gands with lungs are adapted to Gand&apos;s ammonia-rich atmosphere, but they are poisoned by oxygen and must use a special breathing apparatus if they want to leave Gand. Gands without lungs have special regeneration properties, demonstrated by their ability to recover quickly from injuries and even regrow lost limbs (As shown by Ooryl Qrygg in the X-wing series by Michael Stackpole). Gands are not allowed to use personal pronouns unless they have achieved something extraordinary. A young or underachieving Gand talks about himself or herself in third person and calls themselves &apos;Gand&apos;. If a Gand achieves something notable, they can use their family&apos;s surname, but will still use the third person. A second, more impressive feat allows the heroic Gand to choose a first name for himself. Only the best-known Gands are allowed to use the first person, and then only after their aptitude has been audited by a jury, in what is called a janwuine-jika, after which they are declared janwuine. However, should a Gand be ashamed of their deeds, they would &quot;reduce&quot; their name when talking about themselves. Many Gands choose a strange profession, the Findsman. A Findsman is a shaman as well as a police officer. The Findsman will interpret the shapes of gases and make prophecies, usually about fugitives. Then, the Findsman will track the fugitive to bring him to justice. During the reign of the Empire, some Findsmen became bounty hunters. One of the best-known Gands is Zuckuss, who was a bounty hunter employed by Darth Vader to hunt down Han Solo, and was at one time the assistant to Bossk. Another well known Gand is Ooryl Qrygg, a pilot in Rogue Squadron, and a very good friend of Corran Horn, both of whom are characters in the book I, Jedi. Ooryl lacked lungs and therefore did not need a mask for normal oxygen environments. He became so honored among Gands that he was given the honor of referring to himself in the first person. It is apparent, based on Corran&apos;s observations, that if Ooryl was troubled or distressed he would speak in the third person until the problem was solved. An example of such an occurrence would be when Corran and Ooryl were in the mess hall on a Mon Calamari cruiser: Ooryl, in mid-conversation, began speaking in the third person, and Corran immediately noticed something was troubling him, with the author (who narrates from Corran&apos;s point of view) noting that Ooryl only...',
  Gank: 'Also known as $Gank Killers$ due to their volatile nature, Ganks are a sentient cyborg species. Ganks are seldom seen without their body-covering armor. Many are found working for Hutts on Nar Shaddaa, but there are other Ganks living in other places besides $The Smuggler$S Moon$. It is also quite common for Ganks to wear armor that represents the planet they live on or the faction they fight for. They are brutal killers that will annihilate anything that gets in their way. There is a story, however, of an encounter a group of Ganks had with the Jedi Master Mace Windu. Surrounded by 14 Ganks, Master Windu simply touched his lightsaber hilt and the Ganks dropped their weapons to the ground.',
  Gen$Dai: 'These large humanoids are encased in heavy armor most of the time, which serves as their exoskeleton. Their nervous and circulatory systems make them extremely resilient. Their nervous system is composed of thousands of clusters allowing them to regenerate limbs and pull nearby limbs back onto their bodies. This unusual nervous system gives them Jedi-like reflexes. They also lack a central heart. They have an advanced vascular system that circulates blood. They lack vital organs making them nearly invulnerable to attack. These odd nervous and circulatory systems may be the cause of their astonishingly long lifespans. There were some Gen&apos;Dai reported to have lived for more than 4,000 years. The most well known Gen&apos;Dai was Durge. He was one of Count Dooku$s lieutenants and also one of the rare cases of $violent Gen&apos;Dai$. Durge fought and bested a young Boba Fett in combat but was later beaten on Muunilinst by Obi-Wan Kenobi, before being killed in space by Anakin Skywalker near the end of the Clone Wars (Anakin trapped Durge in an escape pod then used the Force to guide it into a nearby star).',
  Geonosian: 'The Geonosians are an insectoid species native to the planet Geonosis, a barren rocky world that is home to thousands of factories geared towards mechanical construction. Many of the galaxy&apos;s biggest manufacturing concerns hold contracts with the Geonosians. Geonosians reside in hive colonies in organic-looking spires. George Lucas thought of the creatures as termite-like in terms of how their society formed, including their architecture. All Geonosians have a hard exoskeleton, elongated faces, multi-jointed limbs, and speak in a strange clicking language known as Geonosian. There are two main types of Geonosian: the wingless drones that mostly work as laborers, and the winged aristocrats, which includes royal warriors serving as scouts and providing security to the hive. They look down on their wingless cousins. In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, it is revealed that the Geonosian Queen Karina the Great uses a kind of &apos;brain worm&apos; to ensure the loyalty of other Geonosians. This mind control exists even after the host$s death, although the &apos;Geonosian zombies&apos; have pure white eyes. Geonosians do not have a standing military, although they do arm themselves with sonic blasters and static pikes. They instead use their droid foundries to build armies for corporate interests wealthy enough to afford them like the Trade Federation and the Techno Union. The Geonosians are also the ones who developed the Death Star plans, leading to the race being mostly enslaved under Imperial occupancy as the Death Star itself was being built. But as revealed in Star Wars Rebels two-part episode $Ghost of Geonosis&apos;, the Geonosians were nearly driven to extinction by the Empire to ensure the secrecy of the Death Star as it was nearing completion, and moved to an undisclosed location. Only a Geonosian nicknamed &apos;Klik-Klak&apos; and a queen egg appear to remain on Geonosis. Poggle the Lesser was a Geonosian who appeared in Episode II and oversaw the production of battle droids for the Trade Federation and later provided the bulk of the troops for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He was decapitated by Darth Vader on Mustafar in Episode III. In the video game Star Wars Battlefront II, the player must fight a Geonosian who is trying to use the droid factories on Mustafar to create his own army. He was named Gizor Delso. Geonosians make a unique appearance in Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, appearing with one of two weapons (either their characteristic sonic blaster or a normal blaster rifle) randomly, beyond the player&apos;s control.',
  Givin: 'The Givin are from the planet Yag&apos;Dhul and are often found doing starship repair work because of their exoskeleton, which allows them to withstand depressurization; this vacuum-resistance allows them to resist many forms of deadly gases. Givin are renowned for their extensive knowledge of anything that has to do with numbers, and often are regarded as some of the best mathematicians in the galaxy.',
  Gizka: 'Gizka are a species of small amphibious creatures, appearing in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Whatever their native world, their extraordinary reproduction rate led to a fair amount of Gizka on many worlds, even including uncharted planets such as Rakata Prime, finding their way from the wreckage of crashed starships. It has been alternatively postulated that they came from that planet originally, spreading along with the Infinite Empire. Their exponential population growth led to them being considered pests on almost as many worlds as they inhabited. The Ebon Hawk once played host to a temporary colony of Gizka, in an incident involving mishandled cargo, an Aqualish, and a Tatooine shipping company. To get rid of them the Gizka were given poison and when they attacked other Gizka they passed on the disease exterminating the population. Alternatively, the gizka can be sold or given to a Selkath $petting zoo$ on the water planet of Manaan. The Gizka are a tribute to the popular Star Trek episode, $The Trouble with Tribbles$.',
  Glymphid: 'The Glymphid are a race of amphibian aliens with a rod-thin build, suction cup-tipped digits, and a long proboscis. Notable Glymphids include the podracer Aldar Beedo.',
  Gorax: 'The Goraxes are a race of behemoths from the forest moon of Endor. They can grow up to more than 98 feet in height and dwell on high crags far from the forests of the forest moon. They are mentioned in the Illustrated Star Wars Universe book and one appears as an antagonist in the Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure movie. They are humanoid, with primate-like faces and narrow chins, as well as enormous ears which are highly sensitive to noises made by small animals. They communicate through grumbling noises. The Goraxes wear fur clothes. They are primitive and powerful and frequently make raids on Ewok villages, where they smash through walls and kidnap Ewoks for pets, although the Goraxes usually forget to feed them or crush the unfortunate Ewoks. They hunt at night, since their eyes are sensitive to bright light. The Gorax is solitary and usually doesn$t run into others. The only bond it has is with its pet boar wolves.',
  Gran: 'The Gran (also known as Kinyenians) are a three-eyed alien race, 1.5 to 1.8 meters in height. They are native to the planet Kinyen, though they have colonies across the galaxy, such as on the planets Hok and Malastare. They are characterized by three eyes on stalks, a protruding, goat-like mouth, and orange skin. Gran had a great deal of power within the Galactic Senate, during the later years of the Old Republic. However, by the time the Emperor$s reign descended over the galaxy Gran became less prominent, and suffered from Imperial oppression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the series The Clone Wars, two senators, Senator Kharrus and Senator Philo, make one-episode appearances. They are both killed. Kharrus died in a shuttle crash, and Philo was shot in the back by Cad Bane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Expanded Universe, most notably in the video games, Grans have become one of the most prominent enemies the player has to face, which is seen in the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games.',
  Gree: 'The Gree were a six-tentacled race of cephalopod creatures that had an unusual anatomy with gray skin, large sad-looking eyes along with tall foreheads. These features supported an immense brain sac which flopped oddly behind their heads.',
  Grizmallt: 'The Grizmallt are the original settlers of Naboo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the final days of her life, Queen Tasia personally sponsored the last such expedition. With the blessing of a famous Jedi Master, the colony ship Beneficent Tasia and its support starships, Constant and Mother Vima, left Grizmallt in search of fortune and glory. The expedition targeted the galaxy$s dangerous southern quadrant, then home to a handful of settlements. On Grizmallt, Queen Tasia$s dying wish was that this last expedition would find a home deep within unexplored space. Shortly after she perished, however, the Beneficent Tasia also went silent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inhabitants of Grizmallt assumed that Beneficent Tasia had been lost, but the starship did, in fact, survive the many hazards of unknown space. Although severely damaged and unable to contact Grizmallt, the expedition eventually reached Naboo$s orbit. As if guided by Tasia$s last wish, the settlers discovered that Naboo was a pastoral, peaceful world rich in natural resources and quite capable of supporting human life. In approximately 3900 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), the Grizmallt colonists crash landed on Naboo to stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within weeks of their arrival, the settlers encountered the Gungans, the planet$s native sentient species. Although immediately distrustful of one another, neither species attacked the other and the humans were allowed to establish their first settlement without incident. Over the next several decades, the settlers slowly spread across the planet$s largest landmass, building cities and villages to support their growing numbers. The human colonists kept to the grassy plains and ocean coastlines, only occasionally treading into Gungan territory. Despite this, tension between the humans and the Gungans remained strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gungans named the human settlers as &quot;Naboo&quot; , the Gungan word for &quot;foolish&quot; or &quot;plainsfolk&quot; as the humans settled on the dry grassy northern plains of the planet which the indigenous Gungans considered foolish, being undesirably dry and hostile to their way of life. The amphibious Gungans dwell in the southern wet swamplands, lakes and seas of the planet.',
  Grysk_Yuuzhan_Vong: 'Initially introduced as the Yuuzhan Vong in the book series The New Jedi Order (1999–2003), the species were an extragalactic, technophobic, fanatically religious species who were intent upon conquering the galaxy, which they attempted during the Yuuzhan Vong War (25–29 ABY). They were both invisible to direct Force sight and unaffected by direct Force powers. The Yuuzhan Vong used biotechnology instead of mechanical technology. Their homeworld was at first in a different galaxy and was called Yuuzhan$tar, which was destroyed in the Cremlevian War. Some went to a seed that was produced from the ashes of Yuuzhan$Tar which was first seen by people in the Unknown Regions and was called Zonama Sekot. Others went to Coruscant, which they renamed Yuuzhan$tar upon conquering the planet in 27 ABY, ending the New Republic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Yuuzhan Vong believed that all other races were little more than barbarians who were not fit to live in their presence. Because of this the Vong attempted to conquer the universe with little thought to the damage they were doing to the universe or its inhabitants. The only race the Vong saw as a threat, or as close to a threat as they were willing to believe, were Wookiees. They saw them as fierce warriors and felt that they deserved to live. For this reason, the Vong enslaved Wookiees rather than attempting to destroy them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the fall of Coruscant, the scattered New Republic$s troops reorganized and joined forces with the Imperial Remnant (established in 12 ABY) to form the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (or simply Galactic Alliance) in 28 ABY, which managed to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong and drive them back to the Unknown Regions in 29 ABY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The invasion is coming, Lord Vader. But I have now bought the Empire time to prepare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; — Grand Admiral Thrawn, to Darth Vader',
  Grysk: 'After the October 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the Yuuzhan Vong were declared non-canonical in April 2014. In their stead, the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) introduced the First Order, a faction that arose from one of many Imperial Remnants between 5 and 21 ABY, and eventually destroyed the New Republic in 34 ABY, while the Resistance (formed in 28 ABY) continued to fight against the First Order. A canonical version of the Yuuzhan Vong, now known as the Grysk, were introduced in the Timothy Zahn novel Thrawn: Alliances (2018). Both species are described as having sloping foreheads and skull-like faces, and being a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy hailing from the Unknown Regions and enslaving other races, though the Grysk use conventional mechanical technology rather than biotechnology, as the novel is set in an earlier time frame than the previous non-canonical Legends novels.',
  Gungan: '&quot;Gungan&quot; redirects here. For the village in Iran, see Gunkan. For the frogs often called &quot;gungans&quot; in Queensland, see Uperoleia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gungans, also known as Goongas, have humanoid amphibious bodies, but their heads are elongated with large, dangling fin-like ears. They are amphibian in blood and seem to have evolved from frogs and toads, given their incredible jumping. They live in underwater cities on the planet Naboo. The principal Gungan character in the movies is Jar Jar Binks; the ruler of the Gungans is Boss Nass. Boss Nass is an Ankura, a subspecies of Gungan. The only other Gungans to be given a name in the films are Captain Tarpals and Augara Jowil, though the novelization also mentions a General Ceel and The Yellow Dart. Other games have shown other leaders including Boss Gallo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gungans and the Naboo (human inhabitants of Naboo) did not get along, as the Gungans believed the Naboo to be pompous cowards, while the Naboo believed the Gungans to be barbarians. This attitude lasted until Queen Amidala united the Gungans and Naboo to fight the Trade Federation in the Battle of Naboo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the Battle of Naboo, the Gungans attained representation in the Senate through Representative Jar Jar Binks, who became very close friends with Senator Padmé Amidala.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gungans reproduce sexually; although they seem androgynous, the males tend to be taller and more muscular than the females, who usually tie their long ears back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gungans ride the Kaadu, and maintain the Fambaa both are amphibious creatures.',
  Habassa: 'The only mention of the Habassa is in the X-Wing video game. They originate from the planet Habassa II which was enslaved by the Empire. After the Battle of Yavin, they joined the Alliance.',
  Hapan: 'The Hapans are the people of the Hapes Cluster and the Hapes Consortium. The Hapes Cluster is very bright, so Hapans$ vision at night is not as good as other humans. Though similar to humans, they are known for being beautiful, especially the women. The women are also the dominant sex. Hapans speak the Hapan language.',
  Jawa: 'The Jawas are a pygmy rodent&ndash;like race inhabiting the desert planet of Tatooine. They are usually 1&ndash;1.5 m (3 ft 3 in &ndash; 4 ft 11 in) tall. They work as scavengers and tinkerers, picking up discarded or broken machinery and fixing it up to resell as well as stealing anything that catches their eye. Jawas are usually peaceful unlike Tusken Raiders, but may sometimes use ion blasters or other weapons to defend themselves. They are entirely covered in tan cloaks, with their faces hidden in hoods and only their glowing yellow or red eyes visible. For transport in the desert world, they use long-abandoned mining Sandcrawlers. These lumbering giants can house a family unit as well as store cargo that they have collected on their journeys. Jawas belong to clans. Half of the clan works in the Sandcrawler, while the other half lives in desert fortresses made from wrecked spaceships for protection against Tusken Raiders and krayt dragons. They also serve as a home for the rest of the Jawa clan which stores the wealth gathered by the other family unit in the Sandcrawler. Jawas have a reputation with Tatooine locals for being swindlers and thieves. Jawas appear briefly in Star Wars: Episode I &ndash; The Phantom Menace during the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace, and in Episode II &ndash; Attack of the Clones, giving directions to Anakin Skywalker. They also appear in Star Wars: A New Hope when they picked up C-3PO and R2-D2 and sold them to Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker, as well as multiple Jawas appearing among the riffraff in Jabba the Hutt\'s palace in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Two Jawas and a Sandcrawler are seen at the end of The Rise of Skywalker. Jawas also appear on the planet Arvala-7 in "Chapter 2: The Child", the second episode of the television series The Mandalorian, in which they are depicted with red eyes (recalling Ralph McQuarrie\'s concept art). Although their faces are never seen by viewers, they are described in The Mandalorian as being "very furry". Though Jawas are based upon Tatooine, some Jawas have left the planet and built up their civilizations elsewhere, such as the tribe on Arvala-7. Because Jawas enjoy scavenging, they tend to build their Sandcrawlers and engage in the same activities on other planets as they do on Tatooine. Specialists studying the past of the Sand People of the Tusken Raiders also used the term Ghorfa to denote an earlier sedentary phase of their culture, and, lastly Kumumgah, for the earliest stratum of sentient civilization on the planet, believed by some to represent a common ancestry shared by the Tuskens and the Jawas.',
  Jungle_Felucian: 'The Jungle Felucians, more commonly referred to as the Felucians, were an amphibious sentient species native to the planet Felucia. Viewed as strange and unusual by other species, the Felucians possessed two sets of arms&mdash;one ending in four webbed digits, and the other in three dexterous fingers&mdash;as well as a head consisting of a thick mass of tendrils. Members of the species usually stood 1.9 meters tall and weighed ninety kilograms. The Felucians were naturally sensitive to the Force and were in tune with their home planet\'s ever-changing balance of that energy field. The Felucians possessed no advanced technology and lived a somewhat primitive lifestyle. Unlike many other primitive species, the Felucians were not divided into multiple tribes; rather, they were all members of a single tribe spanning the entirety of Felucia. However, the species did have strict class stratification. Three of their most prominent classes were the warriors, the shamans, and the chieftains.',
  Kaleesh: 'The Kaleesh are a nomadic and politically neutral race from the planet Kalee. A bipedal reptilian species, the Kaleesh have reddish-brown scaly skin and cover almost all their bodies (they usually leave their four-fingered claws exposed) to protect them from Kalee&amp;#39;s blistering sun. The Kaleesh are also renowned for their warrior culture and combat prowess. Most of them wear masks that are carved from the skulls of the planet&amp;#39;s most feared creatures such as the karabac and the mumuu.',
  Kaminoan: 'Kaminoans are tall, thin, pale-skinned aliens, with distinctively long necks, which live on the isolated planet of Kamino. Males also have a ridge along the back of their heads. They like to be isolated from the galaxy. Kaminoans were forced to reproduce through cloning, after a natural disaster on Kamino. They work creating and training clones for third parties from stations on large platforms above the sea. Kaminoans seem to be unconcerned about the ethics of their workings. Darth Tyranus erased all traces of the planet Kamino from the Jedi archives. Kaminoans developed the Grand Army of the Republic, as shown in Star Wars: Episode II &ndash; Attack of the Clones. They resemble the stereotypical image of grey aliens in their face and limbs, and engage in similar activities that seem to revolve around genetics and physical experiments with their test subjects. Kaminoans were able to see colours in the ultraviolet and the infrared spectrum. While to human eyes the halls of the Kaminoan cities were spotless white, to the Kaminoans they were vividly colored. Taun We and Lama Su are examples of Kaminoans.',
  Kilji: 'The Kilji are a species of religious zealots who reside in the galaxy&amp;#39;s Unknown Regions; their home is the Kilji homeland, from which the Kiljis&amp;#39; nation, the Kilji Illumine, engages in its conquests of enlightenment.

They require masks to protect them from oxygen-rich atmospheres and to protect their highly sensitive eyes from light. They are also known for their Force Sages, the Baran Do. One prominent Kel Dor is the Jedi Master and Council member, Plo Koon.',
  Keshiri: 'The Keshiri are a near-human species from the Wild Space planet of Kesh. Their characteristics include purple or lavender coloured skin and hair colours which include silver and white shades. About five thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, a Sith starship crash landed on Kesh; the crew, who came to become known as the Lost Tribe of Sith, subsequently subjugated the Keshiri, some of whom eventually joined the Sith. The Keshiri were introduced in the Fate of the Jedi novels.',
  Kiffar: 'The Kiffar are a near-human species from the Azurbani system, including Kiffu and Kiffex. The Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was a Kiffar. Their characteristics include dark, tanned skin and long thick dark hair, usually worn in dreadlocks, and some have ceremonial tattoos. One in a hundred Kiffar inherits a psychometric talent to read the history of objects that they touch. The Kiffar are clannish and their strongest members comprise an order known as the Guardians, which are rather powerful.',
  Kitonak: 'Kitonaks (also known as Kirdans) are white, pudgy aliens from Kirdo III. They show a tough skin which folds to seal vulnerable openings, a trait evolved to protect them from the harsh environment of Kirdo&amp;#39;s deserts. They also have some double organs, including two pairs of lungs. Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band, Anarc, Kruc, and Terno are the only known Kitonaks.',
  Klatooinian: 'Klatooinians come from the planet Klatooine. When the Hutts were waging a war against Xim the Despot, they looked for help on some planets. As a result, the Hutts asked the Klatooinians to become part of their army. Since the Klatooinians thought it was some kind of sacred war, their leader Barada M&amp;#39;Beg signed a treaty so that the Klatooinians would be slaves of the Hutts forever. After defeating Xim, Klatooinians remained slaves of the Hutts. Most of their children are named Barada to honour Barada M&amp;#39;Beg. One of the thugs on Jabba the Hutt&amp;#39;s skiff was a Klatooinian named Barada. See also Nikto and Klaatu barada nikto, a famous quote from The Day the Earth Stood Still. One Klatooinian Jedi is Tarados Gon. He can be seen in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis. In The Mandalorian episode 4, "The Sanctuary". Some Klatooinian bandits raid a small villager on the planet Sorgan. They somehow acquire an imperial AT-ST walker. Fortunately the Mandalorian and Cara Dune were able to take them out and save the village.',

  Kowakian_monkey_lizard: 'The Kowakian monkey-lizards are a vulturous sentient species from the planet Kowak. They are small, with beak-like mouths and large ears. When born monkey-lizards come out in a larval state. It is a well-known fact that monkey-lizards laugh, a lot. On their home planet their laughter is used to scare predators away, because of how loud they laugh. When in captivity, they are not paired with other species because their laughter is too great and too loud. Salacious B. Crumb was one of the most famous Kowakian monkey-lizards, as he is the only one seen in any of the Star Wars movies. An unnamed, fuchsia-skinned Kowakian monkey-lizard appears in 2 episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, "Dooku Captured" and "The Gungan General", as the pet of Hondo Ohnaka, leader of a band of Weequay pirates. Another Kowakian monkey-lizard is seen roasting on a spit at a market in the first episode of The Mandalorian as a second monkey lizard watches from a nearby cage.',
  Kubaz: 'The Kubaz are an insect-eating species with long snouts, that have been known to be informants for the Empire. One such Kubaz, by the name of Garindan, led Imperial stormtroopers to the droids on Tatooine in A New Hope.

  Kushiban: 'Kushiban are small rabbit-like creatures that live on Kushibah in the Star Wars galaxy. Distinguishing features include large black eyes, floppy ears, and a long tail. They are capable of walking on either their hind legs or on all fours, though to move more quickly in a run or a charge, they must run with all four appendages. On their hind legs they stand at 0.5 meters or 1.6404 feet tall, with an extra 0.3 meters&amp;#39; worth of tail. While often mistaken for cute, pet-like animals, they are actually intelligent beings with a complex culture as well as both a written and spoken language. They have mastered fire (used to frighten away hostile, fire-fearing Xinkras) and can use technology. Rather than paws, they have hands with opposable thumbs and feet. As a means of communication, Kushibans&amp;#39; fur changes color in correlation to its mood. A Kushiban in a calm, normal state of emotions is white; a Kushiban in the deepest of despairs is totally black.',
  Kwa: 'The Kwa were an ancient, blue-skinned race that lived on the planet Dathomir. They created the Star Temples and the Infinity Gate on Dathomir around 100,000 BBY. Over time the Kwa sealed their temples and left large wuffa worms to guard them. Nobody really knows what happened to the Kwa, but the ones that were on Dathomir devolved into the primitive Kwi.',
  Kwi: 'A primitive, blue-skinned, saurians species native to Dathomir, the Kwi degenerated from the Kwa, the masterminds behind the Star Temples and Infinity Gate on Dathomir.

They see through the Force and are often shocked by life not connected to the Force. Their adopted homeworld is Alpheridies, where they migrated after their original homeworld became unstable. Over generations, they adapted to see in the infra-red spectrum instead of visible light. A notable event in their history was the destruction of the colony world Katarr by Darth Nihilus, leaving only Visas Marr, who later became a servant of Darth Nihilus and helped destroy him.',
  Mirialan: 'The Mirialan race is native to the planet Mirial. They have purer eye colors than humans, with some having either paler or darker skin colors and tattoos on their faces that represent personal achievements.

They have high-domed heads, large eyes positioned toward the sides, and webbed hands. They can breathe underwater up to 30 meters deep and coexist with the Quarren on their home planet. During the Clone Wars, they fought against the Quarren and the CIS. In the Galactic Civil War, they joined the Rebel Alliance and played a crucial role in starship construction. Admiral Ackbar is a well-known Mon Calamari, and Quarrie was a spacecraft engineer known for designing the B-wing starfighter prototype.',
  Mustafarian: 'Mustafarians are the native inhabitants of Mustafar. They have leathery skin with a cloak and a trunk. Not much else is known about this species as they live in seclusion. They are believed to be sentient and are able to withstand extreme temperatures. They have saddles for lava fleas and carry defensive laser rifles. As a manhood ritual they leap across &quot;water-falls&quot; of magma wearing no protection. When the Techno Union established mining facilities on the planet, many of the Mustafarians took up jobs as workers at one of the many mining facilities. The Mustafarians are the indigenous species of Mustafar. They are a primitive race known for their resistance to the planet&apos;s extreme volcanic conditions. The species was largely displaced or enslaved by the Empire, which exploited Mustafar for its resources. The most famous Mustafarian is the one who appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series as a leader of a group of Mustafarians who were fighting against the Empire’s presence on their planet.',

During the Clone Wars, Muuns helped the Separatists and minted new coins for planets leaving the Republic. Notable Muun were Darth Sidious$ master, Darth Plagueis the Wise, and the ruling members of the InterGalactic Banking Clan including San Hill. Darth Plagueis had the ability to use the dark side of the force to influence midi-chlorians to create life and to prevent people from dying, the only Force user to have such a power.',

However Nautolans are relatively common at any space port. Nautolans reflect the moods of those around them. When confronted by anger and violence, they respond in kind. When approached in a calm, civilized manner, they seem helpful and polite. Jedi Master Kit Fisto was a Nautolan.',
  Neimoidian: 'Neimoidians are the most visible villains of the film The Phantom Menace. According to the Star Wars expanded universe, Neimoidians are descendants of Duro colonists that landed on Neimoidia in the year of the Republic inception. At some point in their development, the Neimoidians learned to domesticate giant beetles, and they have been getting others to do physical labor for them ever since as stated in Labyrinth of Evil. By the time of The Phantom Menace, the Neimoidians control the galaxy$ largest commercial corporation and are at the head of the powerful Trade Federation. Neimoidians are born as grubs and placed in communal hives until the age of seven. Inadequate food is fed to young Neimoidians in order to encourage acquisitiveness. Those who hoard enough food survive while those who do not hoard die. Even as adults, Neimoidians tend to be greedy, possessive, and fearful of death. Eventually, the grubs learn that to survive, they must kill each other; therefore out of the many grubs that are born, very few survive. Neimoidians have been stereotyped by other races in the galaxy as corrupt and greedy, particularly after the Battle of Naboo. They are certainly willing to resort to extortion, lies, and manipulation, but their success also lies in exceptional organizational abilities. Training in the organization revolves around Neimoidia$ mass hives and huge fungus farms. The Neimoidians do not view themselves as wicked, but rather focused on being the best they can be in their society. The Trade Federation army is employed only when &quot;future customers&quot; do not realize their &quot;best interest&quot; in trading with Neimoidians, in Neimoidian terms. However, following the battle of their homeworld, many of their grub hatcheries were destroyed by Clone Troopers late into the Clone Wars, in which they were quickly adaptable to the impact of their culture. So they then associated themselves with their Duro cousins, first by destroying the remaining communal hives and burning down all the fungus farms in order to distance themselves from millennia of internal oppression. Neimoidian culture is extremely hierarchical. Although the monarch of the Neimoidians is never seen in the films, every Neimoidian ship carries a hologram of her. Amongst the seen Neimoidians, clothing denotes status: Lott Dod wears a tall diplomatic ploov and a purple representative$s mantle over a very expensive robe of Tyrian violet cloth. Nute Gunray, Commanding Viceroy of the Federation army, wears a showy crested tiara and blue viceroy$s collar. Rune Haako, legal counsel to Nute, wears an attorney$s cowl. Daultay Dofine, captain of the flagship vessel for the Naboo invasion, wears a tall command officer$s mitre. An unnamed Neimoidian wears a lavender collar identifying him as a financial officer. The most exalted Neimoidians rank a walking mechno-chair. Neither comfortable nor practical, techno-chairs are very expensive beetle-like seats that can carry lazy Neimoidians or project hologram transmissions. Neimoidians also employ a number of prestigious protocol droids, including the brilliantly silver TC-14. TC-14 is kept docile through frequent memory wipes and is employed to distract guests while the Neimoidians devise manipulation strategies. In contrast to the rare and showy technology of the Neimoidian elite, the battle forces of the Neimoidians are mechanically advanced, but cheaply mass-produced. An emphasis is placed on massive, intimidating numbers of mindless battle droids controlled through a central computer. This unquestioning reliance on a central control is what will ultimately spell failure for the mechanized army. Episode II revealed that their form closely resembles that of the vaguely insect-like natives of Geonosis, where the droids are mass-produced. Much like many of the Imperial Officers in the Original Star Wars Trilogy were given British accents, some Neimoidians have been given Thai accents.',
  Nelvaanian: 'Canine-muzzled humanoids introduced in Season 3 of the animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars. They live on the planet Nelvaan on the Outer Rim. All of their warrior braves were captured by Techno-Union scientists and were physically and mentally mutated into large bear-like creatures with their left arms replaced with laser cannons, to try to create perfect cyborg soldiers for the CIS. During the Liberation of Nelvaan, Anakin Skywalker, who was referred to by the race as "Holt Kezed" ("Ghost Hand" in their language), would free them as he destroyed the Separatist base. Following this, Anakin killed all Techno-Union scientists there and managed to bring the mutated Nelvaanians back to their tribe. On a behind-the-scenes note, the name "Nelvaanian" may be a reference to Nelvana, the Canadian animation company who produced the Star Wars: Droids and Star Wars: Ewoks animated features for Lucasfilm. Nelvana\'s logo is a blue polar bear.',
  Neti: 'The Neti were a race of sentient shape-shifting tree-like beings from Rykk. Jedi Master Ood Bnar was a Neti.',
  Nikto: 'The Nikto people are a humanoid species from the planet Kintan who have scaly skin, black eyes, and symmetrical horns and spikes on their faces. Subspecies include Green Nikto (Kadas\'sa\'Nikto) and Red Nikto (Kajain\'sa\'Nikto). Niktos are first introduced in Return of the Jedi (1983) in the form of Klaatu, a Green Nikto who serves Jabba the Hutt. Red Nikto appear in The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). Ima-Gun Di is a Red Nikto Jedi Master in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Nikto of both subspecies were protecting The Child in the episode "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian" of The Mandalorian. In the 2016 novel Star Wars: Bloodline, the Red Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di heads a dangerous cartel based on the planet Bastatha. The bombardment of Kintan by stellar radiation from the explosion of a nearby star had sparked rapid evolution in its native species. For several centuries, the Niktos were ruled over by a violent and fanatical religious organization called the Cult of M\'dweshuu, which was much despised by the majority of Kintan\'s population. When the Hutts were waging a war against Xim the Despot, they saw the Niktos\' situation as an opportunity to recruit another servant species into their army. A fleet of Huttese starships bombarded the Cult of M\'dweshuu\'s stronghold from orbit, wiping it out, and the grateful Niktos eagerly signed the Treaty of Vontor, placing themselves in servitude to the Hutts indefinitely.',
  Noghri: 'The Noghri are a primitive humanoid species with steely gray skin. They are extremely skilled assassins due to their innate abilities at stealth and hand-to-hand combat. Like the Wookiees, they respect honor above all else. The Noghri are natives of the planet Honoghr, which was ravaged by toxins from a Trade Federation core ship destroyed in battle during the Clone Wars. Darth Vader visited the planet some time later under the guise of helping it recover from the ecological disaster, in exchange recruiting most of the young males of the planet into a bond of servitude as the personal assassins of Emperor Palpatine. With the Noghri still in service to the Galactic Empire five years after the death of Palpatine, Grand Admiral Thrawn orders them to kidnap the pregnant Leia Organa Solo. Realizing that neither she nor her children would be truly safe as long as the Noghri serve the Empire, she goes to Honoghr in order to convince the Noghri to leave the Empire\'s service. Through their acute sense of smell, the Noghri easily recognize Leia as the daughter of the revered Vader, and she is able to use this fact to convince the Noghri that the Empire has been lying to them and has kept them in virtual slavery for many years. As a result, the Noghri turn against the Empire. Thrawn dies when his Noghri bodyguard Rukh turns on him and stabs him. Following the death of Thrawn, the Noghri ally themselves with the New Republic. They help resettle the Noghri to other planets (including Wayland) to give Honoghr time to heal. Leia and her entire family become very highly respected figures in Noghri society. The Noghri save the Solo family from a Yuuzhan Vong strike force. Much like Chewbacca did with Han Solo, the Noghri always make sure Leia has bodyguards. The Noghri appear extensively in the Thrawn trilogy of novels, written by Timothy Zahn, and are also playable in the Forces of Corruption Expansion for Star Wars Empire at War, armed with disrupter rifles.',

  Ogemite: 'The Ogemite are a near-Human avian race native to the planet Ogem. They have yellow skin and short, blond, feather-like hair, similar to the Omwati.',
  Omwati: 'Although the Omwati are not a branch of humanity, the differences are extremely small. The Omwati skin is a bluish color and their eyes are generally blue or black. The size of an adult Omwati borders that of a human, although their morphology is typically slightly frailer with regard to females. There are very few Omwati with a stout physiology. Their most striking characteristic is their "hair" which appears to be made of small, diaphanous feathers of an iridescent color. Omwati do not have any other hair. The Omwati rarely left their homeworld and rarely took part in galactic events, until Wilhuff Tarkin enslaved the youngest of their species to serve as Imperial scientists. Qwi Xux is perhaps the best-known member of the Omwati species. She was a researcher at the Imperial Maw Installation and a principal designer of the Death Star. The Rogue Jedi Kyp Durron ripped her memories of both this technology and her past from her mind.',
  Ongree: 'The Ongree are a bizarre looking species from the Skustell Cluster. The Jedi Pablo-Jill was an Ongree.',
  Ortolan: 'The Ortolans are a race of fat, blue-skinned creatures with long snouts, not all that different from a small elephant.

Possessing a love of food and music, these small aliens are also adept at surviving the frigid temperatures of their homeworld Orto.',
  Oswaft: 'Large manta-ray like creatures that were encountered by Lando Calrissian during his early adventures in the Outer Rim. They live in a nebula called ThonBoka where they are nourished by nutrients from their sun. They live in the vacuum of space and have the unusual ability to travel through hyperspace for short distances. If an Oswaft is deprived of nutrients from a star for too long it will turn opaque and die. They can also subsist on the waste products of spaceships such as the Millennium Falcon and produce waste in the form of valuable minerals.',
  Paaerduag: 'Paaerduag consist of two aspects: a larger, more mobile humanoid form with long, slender arms and legs, and a broad head; and a smaller aspect that rides on the larger one like a backpack. The smaller aspect resembles a humanoid with a slender, dog-like face and two sets of eyes. While the larger aspect\'s voice is inaudible to human ears, the smaller one can be heard and understood. The smaller aspect refers to itself using the term &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me.&quot; whose actual name was unpronounceable in Galactic Basic Standard, were symbionts that consisted of a large, yellowish, hunchbacked, two-legged creature with a small green, four-eyed creature sprouting out of its back. Much of the language, including the true name of their homeworld, was not pronounceable or comprehensible by non-Paaerduag, for one required two mouths and four ears to truly speak and hear it. The green head communicated with non-Paaerduag, as the sounds produced by the other could not be heard by most species. Their homeworld was Sorjus, a planet far off the Perlemian Trade Route. At birth, the two humanoid components were separate beings, which as they grew up, fused together. It seems the larger creature controlled movement as the smaller creature would tell it to turn around so it could see things opposite itself. Paaerduags were seen often around the time of the Jedi Civil War, and Revan encountered two Paaerduags during his travels; one named Ja\'Gatcha, who was trapped on Taris due to the Sith quarantine and was likely killed when Darth Malak\'s fleet bombarded the surface from orbit. Another was named Mic\'tunan\'jus Orgu, a merchant in Anchorhead on Tatooine. Their home is Sorjus, a small and unimportant world far off the Perlemian trade route, and has a temperate climate (as inferred from Mic\'Tunan\'Jus\' complaints about Tatooine\'s climate being far too dry, and the dust is rough on their hide). They begin life as individuals, however, at the age of choosing, they become bonded to their other half, and grow together as a single, complete being, sharing their brains, vision, hearing, and speech. There are two Paaerduag in Knights of the Old Republic: one in Javyar\'s Cantina on Taris, the other is a merchant in the docking area of Tatooine.',
  Pa_lowick: 'The Pa_lowick are native to the swampy world of Lowick. They have bulbous bodies supported by long, thin legs. Their eyes are on short stalks that jut from their heads, and their mouths are located at the end of a long, thin proboscis. Most Pa_lowicks do not leave the planet. Other species travel to Lowick to mine the rare and beautiful Lowickian firegems. A notable Pa_lowick is Sy Snootles, the singer of the Max Rebo Band and former girlfriend of Ziro the Hutt. Other known Pa_lowicks include Sam Snootles, Keesa, Larisselle Chatrunis, and Aneesa Dym.',
  Pau_an: 'The Pau_an are gaunt, near-human natives of the planet Utapau. They are also known as Utapauns or Ancients due to their long lifespans (up to 700 years), much longer than the Utai, the other species native to Utapa that they co-exist with on Utapau. The two species get along well, with the lanky Pau_ans having leadership roles on the planet. The species is taller on average than Humans are, at approximately 1.9 meters. They are bald, and their head is striped with furrowed, grey skin. Pau_ans weigh seventy kilograms on average. They have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, and is able to see well in darkness due to the fact that they live in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. Pau_an society is generally friendly, and they are happy to welcome guests to their often-overlooked world. Pau_ans have four fingers and toes. They often wear elaborate clothes intended to heighten their impressive stature. Most Pau_ans speak both Utapese and Basic. Due to living in the Outer Rim Territories, the Pau_ans experienced isolation for much of their history due to Utapau\'s remoteness. In 19 BBY, during the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Utapau. The Pau_ans resisted the Confederacy with the assistance of the Galactic Republic. Subsequently, when the Galactic Empire took control of the planet following the Declaration of a New Order, the Pau_ans opposed Imperial rule as well. The Pau_ans fulfilled most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the Utai did not desire such work, serving as labourers instead. Most Pau_ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gave them experience that would be used throughout their long lives. Pau_ans were kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Despite the many differences between the Pau_ans and the Utai, the two species were able to co-exist peacefully, although inhabitants of the different Utapaun cities often had conflicts due to philosophical differences. Still, these conflicts rarely developed into bloodshed, and it was more common for the cities to ignore each other. Each city had its own culture, and competition was fierce between the groups. However, they were able to cooperate when the situation necessitated it, such as during the Confederate invasion of the planet in 19 BBY. Pau_an society is characterized by a fusion of various styles and cultures, a result of the ancient integration with the Utai. Their settlements, such as the Pau City spaceport that is built into sinkhole walls, showcase a mix of architectural styles and unique designs. The Pau_ans have a penchant for art, engaging in the study of sculptures and integrating diverse artistic styles into their architecture. Despite their seemingly primitive appearance, Pau_ans have developed an industrial society, with the Utai undertaking the labor-intensive tasks. The Pau_ans utilize wind power, harnessed through massive windmills, to generate over ninety-nine percent of the planet\'s energy. Notably, many Pau_ans prefer riding living beasts like varactyls and dactillions instead of using speeders. Each city on Utapau is governed by the individual holding the title of Master of Port Administration in that city. These administrators are supported by advisory councils to assist in decision-making. The overall governance of the planet is overseen by the Utapauan Committee, consisting of representatives from various cities. While this committee exists, crucial decisions are infrequent, as the cities are generally self-sufficient, only turning to the Utapauan Security Force when needed. Pau_ans represented 30%—or approximately 28.5 million—of Utapau\'s total population of 90 million inhabitants, although their influence as administrators and leaders more than made up for their lack of numbers. Darth Desolous was a Pau_an as was the Imperial Grand Inquisitor.',
  Phlog: 'The Phlogs are peaceful giants living on planet Genesia. Phlogs are giant sapients. They are used throughout the galaxy as guards, thugs, and gladiators, on planets such as Genesia. One group intended for slavery became stranded on the forest moon of Endor.',
  Polis_Massan: 'Polis Massans are humanoid aliens who inhabit the asteroid colony of Polis Massa. These thin, mute beings lead mining expeditions and medical research on their remote settlement. Polis Massa is actually the largest remnant of their original homeworld, which was fractured by a natural cataclysm. The survivors took up residence there and began mining the asteroid for artifacts from their former civilization. These archaeological digs were in progress for so long that the mining supervisors came to be known as Polis Massans, having adopted the asteroid as their new homeworld. Polis Massans are characterized by their short, thin stature, flat and pale faces, and grey hands with four long, dexterous fingers. Due to their lack of speech, they communicate using sign language and devices. They also possess limited telepathy. Polis Massans have osmotic membrane faces and growth rings encircling their wiry bodies. Many of them engage in professions such as mining, medicine, or exobiology. Their typical attire consists of form-fitting bodysuits equipped with various signaling devices, medical equipment, and utility pouches. Most Polis Massan miners are seasoned spelunkers who dig deep into the core of Polis Massa to recover prized artifacts. They analyze the artifacts for organic tissue suitable for cloning. For this reason, they set up a medical facility on the asteroid. Although they have little contact with humans, Polis Massans are known for their extraordinary medical skills, and are regarded as compassionate beings who understand the value of life. Polis Massan medics and technicians helped to deliver the Skywalker twins when Padmé Amidala was rushed to the asteroid facility in critical condition. Only two members of the team were trained physicians. The rest were exobiologists. Although the twins were delivered safely with the help of a midwife droid, the Polis Massans could not mend Padmé\'s broken heart, and she died at the medical center.',
  Priapulin: 'The Priapulin are a caterpillar-like species from the planet Pria. They have extremely flexible bodies, with five knobby limbs and six eyes. The Priapulins are naturally curious creatures, and they possess a highly developed sense of smell. Their diet consists mostly of vegetation, though they are also known to consume small creatures on occasion. They are known for their unique ability to detect chemical changes in the environment, which they use to locate food and avoid danger. Priapulins are typically covered in a tough, protective exoskeleton that can change color based on their surroundings, allowing them to blend into their environment.',
  Psadan: 'One of the indigenous races of the planet Wayland. This race appeared in the last novel of the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. In The Last Command, they are one of the races that the cloned and insane Jedi master Joruus C$baoth kept under his rule at the foot of Mount Tantiss.',
  P$w$eck: 'The P$w$ecks are a warm-blooded, dinosaur-like species similar in appearance to the Ssi-Ruuk but with lower intelligence, smaller size, short tails and drooping eyes. The Ssi-Ruuk have dominated the P$w$ecks for thousands of years, enslaving and controlling their lives. They are used as slaves, guards and beasts of burden and perform the lowest jobs in Ssi-Ruuvi society.&nbsp;',
  Pyke: 'The Pykes are a fish-like humanoid species from the planet Oba Diah. One notable group of Pykes was the Pyke Syndicate, a criminal organization and one of the most prominent spice dealers in the galaxy. The Pykes first appeared in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, in which the Pyke Syndicate has a major role in Darth Maul and the Death Watch\'s takeover of Mandalore, and is revealed to have been involved in the murder of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas by Count Dooku. The Pykes made their first live-action appearance in Solo: A Star Wars Story. They appeared again in The Book of Boba Fett, in which the Pyke Syndicate fights Boba Fett\'s criminal empire for control of Tatooine\'s spice trade and loses.',
  Quarren: 'Quarrens (or Qarrens) are a species of aquatic humanoids that share the planet of Mon Calamari with another sentient aquatic species, the Mon Calamari. The Quarren are also nicknamed &quot;squid head&quot; around the galaxy due to their resemblance to cephalopods, which Quarren are actually related to. They are more introverted than their neighbours, preferring the deep water to the surface and rarely inviting guests to their domain.&nbsp;During the Clone Wars, the Quarren Isolation League attempted to isolate Mon Calamari from the rest of the galaxy. They were eventually defeated during the Battle of Mon Calamari where Clone SCUBA troopers under the command of Kit Fisto defeated them and their Separatist allies. Notable Quarren include Tessek, who escaped Mon Calamari to work for Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine and Darth Maleval who served with the 407th on the planet Borosk.&nbsp;Quarrens were common leaders in the Exchange during the Old Republic.',
  Quermian: 'A race of sentient vertebrates, the Quermian are a species native to the planet Quermia. They have two brains, a long, thin neck, and six limbs. Their sensitive olfactory glands are located in their hands and they are born with a natural talent in telepathy and mind control. They must look at the person in the eye if they are not force sensitive to perform this task.&nbsp;Among the more noticeable of this species is Jedi Master Yarael Poof. He served on one of the last Jedi High Councils and was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council for training.',
  Rakata: 'The Rakata are an amphibian-humanoid species from the planet Lehon. They ruled an &quot;Infinite Empire&quot; of 500 worlds, several thousand years before the formation of the Republic. They are responsible for Tatooine\'s desert climate due to their razing of the planet, and Kashyyyk\'s lush overgrowth from their terraforming. During the travels of Revan (Knights of the Old Republic), it is discovered that this race went into decline due to the combination of a civil war and genetic plague. It is not known exactly when this happened, but by around 30,000 years before their rediscovery they became nearly extinct.&nbsp;The Rakata also used their technological skills and knowledge to build a massive space station called the Star Forge.',
  Ranat: 'Ranats, known as Con Queecon in their own language, were a species of meter-tall rodents with long, tusk-like incisors jutting from their lower jaws. Though originally from Rydar II, the Ranats there were nearly wiped out by Human colonists in 200 BBY. Three Ranats stowed away on a spice freighter and crash landed on Aralia, where they re-established their species. The Ranat tribes inhabited extensive tunnel networks, resembling intricate mazes, where they collectively raised their offspring. These tribes employed cunning tactics, leading intruders into dead ends to facilitate their elimination. Despite their simple personalities, with minimal displays of emotion beyond the instinct for food, Ranats demonstrated hostility toward both outsiders and members of their own kind. In response to the threat posed by pest-control teams seeking to eliminate them, the tribes cooperated to counter this common adversary. Upon the arrival of entrepreneurs intending to transform Aralia into a planetary amusement park, Ranats resisted the intrusion and coordinated efforts to thwart these developments. The Antemeridian sector government designated Ranats as semi-sentient, allowing sentient beings to defend themselves against the rodents while prohibiting the arming of the species. The movement of well-armed groups to Aralia was restricted to conceal the existence of the Ranats and the controversial assessment of their sentience. Few Ranats were seen away from Aralia, and those that left the world occupied the lowest levels of society. Ranats established themselves on Tatooine, where they lived in the more populated areas as scroungers and traders. One group overran crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure$ Palace after his death, and the Vriichon brothers once owned the Mos Eisley Cantina. During the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial military tested Ranat mercenary bands for possible use against Rebel Alliance forces. Ranats were also found in the employ of the mage Orloc, who attempted to start his own Jedi Order. The Ranat Rik-tak was a member of the Justice Action Network who operated in the Tapani sector. Ranats were omnivores and strongly preferred meat, especially that of Aralia$ native robas. Their sharp incisors and claws were useful as both weapons and tunneling tools. Burrowing wore down their teeth but also released hormones that stimulated tooth growth; unchecked, the incisors could reach prodigious lengths, so most Ranats gnawed constantly to keep them filed back. Ranats were a species of small rodents. They shared many features in common with sentient species such as their distant cousins, the Tintinna, and with other sentient mammals of similar physiology, including Chadra-Fan and Squibs. Nevertheless, the status of Ranats as fully sentient or merely semi-sentient was the subject of galactic debate for centuries. With few exceptions, Ranats stood about a meter high. This small size made them seem innocuous to many who encountered them and belied their power. They had short, well-muscled limbs with four digits on each forepaw and three per hindpaw. All four paws were nimble and capable of fine manipulation. Ranats had short, heavy-duty, retractable claws that, while of limited use in hunting or self-defence, allowed a Ranat to dig through as much as one meter of soil and loose rock in a mere 15 seconds. The Ranat body was tough, wiry, and partially flattened. Exceptional flexibility allowed Ranats to squeeze through small openings that would prove impenetrable to other beings of similar size; the Shi$ido shapeshifter Mammon Hoole often assumed the form of a Ranat to take advantage of this very ability. Although a typical Ranat had a long, scaly, hairless tail, the rodents were almost entirely covered in fur that ranged from dirty blond to dark reddish or greyish brown. Some Ranats groomed themselves, but for most, the coat was filthy and foul-smelling. Understandably, many non-Ranats considered the species to be visually unappealing. Ranats stooped when they stood and scampered and scurried when they ran. They tended to wear little more clothing than cloth hoods, leather belts, and ornamental tooth bands. However, those Ranats who integrated into galactic society often wore full-length tunics and footwear. The Ranats$ eyes, located at the sides of the head, varied in color from beady and black, to red. Their hairless, pink ears were small and round and typically lay flat against the head. A Ranat$ long, pointed snout was full of sharp teeth and terminated in a yellowish-white nose surrounded by long, black whiskers. Their senses were acute: they could see in the dark and detect others$ moods by scent. Ranats spoke in a voice of squeaks and screeches. A Ranat$ bottom two incisors were sharp, pointed, and discolored yellow or brown from tartar and dirt. Gnawing stimulated glands in the Ranat$ jaw to produce growth hormones. Unchecked, this caused the incisors to grow up to a centimeter in a standard hour. The only way to counter the growth was to gnaw even more and wear the teeth down. Some members of the species managed to keep these teeth small enough to fit inside the mouth, but others had incisors that poked out and overlapped the upper lip like tusks. Coupled with their sharp teeth and powerful jaws, these incisors gave Ranats a dangerous bite. Ranats were fecund. Females went into heat at least twice each standard year, during which period they mated with as many males as possible. After fertilization, the fetus gestated for about 120 standard days. The mother then gave birth to a litter of three to six young. The species$ signature incisors began to grow in at adolescence. Members of the species were considered adults at three standard years of age, and the average Ranat could expect to live to be 20 standard years old. A song from the Max Rebo Band, the fictional band in the Star Wars universe that is playing in Jabba the Hutt$ palace in Return of the Jedi, is dedicated to them known as "Kick That Ranat".',
  Rattataki: 'Native to the planet Rattatak, the Rattataki were noticeable for their pale white skin color. They developed a violent culture, like fierce combat involving gladiators of their home world. Asajj Ventress was originally a Rattataki but with the release of season three of the Clone Wars cartoon her back story has been rewritten by the writers of the show and was the most famous member of their species. They were a playable race in Star Wars: The Old Republic.',
  Rishii: 'The Rishii are an avian species from the planet Rishi. They have human-like hands at the ends of their wings. They fly at great speeds from cliffs to catch rodents in their talons. Like most avians, the Rishii live in nests built on cliffs. The Rishii are a kind species, but have an ability to mimic other languages, which, at times, is a little annoying to the people they are mimicking.',
  Rodian: 'Rodians are a species of green, antenna-sporting, bug-eyed humanoids from the planet Rodia. The Rodians are born hunters; they killed most of the wildlife and grew restless with the lack of creatures and began to hunt each other in gladiatorial combat, until the Republic found them. Many continued to hunt as bounty hunters; the most notable specimen was Greedo, the bounty hunter shot by Han Solo in the Mos Eisley cantina in the original Star Wars movie. In the 1997 special edition of Return of the Jedi, two Rodians were added, one named Greeata who served as a dancer in Jabba the Hutt$ palace on Tatooine, and Doda Bodonawieedo (picture on right), a member of the Max Rebo Band who plays the flute. A young Rodian named Wald (played by Warwick Davis), a friend of Anakin Skywalker, appears in The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, Rodians are represented by Senator Onaconda Farr, and Palpatine$ aide Dar Warc. Rodians were one of the species playable in Star Wars: Galaxies. The Hutt colonization of Rodia brought changes to the Rodian race. Old Rodian slowly ceased to be a written and spoken language. Huttese was adopted as the official language and soon came to be spoken by the Rodians. Some Rodians are enlisted in the public service of the Hutts and tend to fare better than others of their race. Any association with the Hutts often brings great rewards but sometimes can bring heavy consequences. Rodians are well suited for the rigors of being a bounty hunter. This is because of their harsh jungle home world, Rodia, and the guerrilla style clan-warfare that they witness (or participate in) on an almost daily basis.',
  Roonan: 'Roonans are a bulbous-headed, almond-eyed alien species from the planet Roona. Notable characters of this race include the Galactic Senate representative Edcel Bar Gane, and the Jedi Knight Halsey.',
  Ruurian: 'Ruurians are like walking, fuzzy Huttlets. They come from Ruuria.',
  Ryn: 'Ryn are a humanoid race. Their bodies are covered in fur that primarily grows in a short fuzz all around, with the exception of their human-like hair and the human-like mustaches on the men. They also have prehensile tails, excellent for grasping things. They are nomadic, with no knowledge of their original home world, and are either hated, ignored, or quietly despised in every corner of the Galaxy, notably such areas as the Corporate Sector, are fond of dance, song, and the enjoyment of life. A peculiar habit of theirs is that a Ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice.\n\nThey apparently once had an impressive warrior tradition on their home world, but that was, save for their tendency to fight tenaciously, apparently lost, although sabacc, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by Hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings (that may not be entirely unjustified when the Force comes into play.)\n\nA Ryn named Droma aided Han Solo in escaping the Jubilee Wheel, a space station in orbit around Ord Mantell, when it was attacked by a Yuuzhun Vong Tizo worm. the two later parted ways only to be reunited later aboard the Queen of Empire. Han later agrees to assist Droma in finding his clan-mates.',
  Saffa: 'The Saffa\'s main contribution is an important art form, the Saffa paintings, which were created after the Saffa made contact with the Thennqora. This artistic medium reached its height approximately 1550–2200 BBY (before the battle of Yavin). One of the few mentions of Saffa paintings occurs in Heir to the Empire, where one of them is seen projected around Grand Admiral Thrawn\'s chair and is mentioned when Thrawn asks Captain Pellaeon what he knows about art. A quick lesson ensues about the importance of art in understanding a species.',
  Sanyassan: 'The Sanyassan Marauders were a savage group of ape-like reptiloids with greyish-green skin originally from the planet Sanyassa that crash landed sometime in the past on the forest moon of Endor. They are featured in the movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. Led by their brutal leader King Terak, they were always searching for a way to get off Endor. However, their ship was beyond repair since they had destroyed it long ago. Terak thought that a mystical Power would make them rulers of the Galaxy. During a raid on Bright Tree Village, Wicket W. Warrick\'s hometown, they captured many Ewoks including Wicket. They also captured Cindel Towani and killed the rest of her family.\n\nWicket and Cindel escaped from the marauders\' fearsome prison cart and found their way to the home of Noa Briqualon. Eventually the Marauders were defeated and their king killed.\n\nThey are also featured in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies.',
  Saurin: 'Saurin are a priestal species, one of the two inhabitant races of the planet Bimmiel.',
  Sauvax: 'The Sauvax were a lobster-like sentient species who hail from Leritor.',
  Sedrian: 'The Sedrians were a little-known pinniped-like race from Sedri.',
  Selkath: 'Selkath are the native species of the planet Manaan. An aquatic species, they are very good swimmers and have the ability to breathe out of water. They resemble anthropomorphic catfish and have aqua-colored skin. In ancient times, their ancestors were slaves to the Rakata. Their planet has only one city above water, the capital, Ahto City, and it is the position of the Selkath to remain neutral in times of intergalactic conflict. Their laws are very harsh, and it is common for violence or attempts to compromise Manaan\'s neutrality to be punished by death. But some believed if the Sith won the Jedi Civil War, they would conquer Manaan. So, they made a secret agreement with the Republic to build a facility right at the kolto source.\n\nAll members of the Selkath race have venom-tipped, retractable claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat is considered dishonourable and a sign of madness. A large, female Firaxan Shark, known as the Progenitor, is seen as either a deity, or even an early evolutionary step in the Selkath chain. This belief is similar to that of a mother Earth goddess, or mother "ocean" goddess in this case.\n\nAfter the events in Knights of the Old Republic, a Force tradition known as the Order of Shasa arose among the Selkath.\n\nThe population of the Selkath has always been low, even in times of prosperity, but there was a greater proportion of Force-sensitives compared to other species. The members of the Order act as seers, advisers, and elite military leaders in times of war. Their main weapon is a fira, a curved sword, similar to a scimitar, constructed of Cortosis and as part of initiation in the Order of Shasa. Some time after the Battle of the Star Forge, the source of Kolto dried up for reasons unknown and foreign groups abandoned Ahto City and the Selkath. As such, the Selkath gradually reverted to primitive ways, and abandoned Ahto City. When the Empire returned centuries later, Ahto City was revived, but the Selkath were enslaved. As in many other examples of racism and speciesism, the Empire polluted the oceans of Manaan and wrecked the environment. Darth Vader himself (a Sith who was closely connected to Darth Sidious, the Emperor) came to the planet, and soon started a quiet, but bloody, revolt of the Selkath against the Empire. However, he told several Force-sensitive Selkath warriors and Shasan Adepts of when and where to strike the Imperial Stormtrooper patrols. It is currently unknown whether the Empire put down this revolt, left the planet, or didn\'t even care.',
  Selonian: 'A furred, burrowing species from the Corellian System, Selonians resemble giant weasels or otters in appearance. Most Selonians are infertile females; one in every 100 is a male, and 5 in 100 are fertile females. Selonians live in clans more akin to insects than mammals, always headed by a female. Although they do possess advanced technology, they usually stay on-planet.&nbsp;They are known to treat lying and deceit as a crime, and like Wookiees, usually don\'t wear clothes.',
  Shawda_Ubb: 'Shawda Ubb are native to the swamp planet Manpha.&nbsp;Shawda Ubb are short and amphibian-like. The character Rappertunie from Return of the Jedi is the only known member of this race.',
  Shi$ido: 'A rare humanoid shape-shifting species of aliens, not entirely unlike Clawdites, except that they also use mind-clouding abilities to infiltrate cultures. The first Shi$ido introduced in the Star Wars Expanded Universe was Senior Anthropologist Mammon Hoole, who authored a study of Tatooine in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, which tells of his impersonating a Jawa and a Tusken Raider.&nbsp;He also featured in the Galaxy of Fear series as the uncle of humans Tash and Zak Arranda, along with Shi$ido Imperial scientist Borborygmus Gog.',
  Shistavanen: 'Colloquially nicknamed &quot;wolfmen&quot;, the Shistavanen are a werewolf-like alien race native to Uvena Prime, one of many habitable planets in the Uvena system.&nbsp;Their bodies are covered in dark hair and they have intimidating, glowing red eyes and sharp fangs. They have very well developed senses, making them extremely good hunters. Like the Wookiees, the Shistavanen are naturally well-suited to work as scouts, but unlike the Wookiees, are more commonly employed by the Empire. Shistavanen are a very xenophobic race who do not like outsiders interfering with their business. Most Shistavanen are aggressive to other races but some are less xenophobic and more sociable, although they are a minority. The race has not been much developed even in the Expanded Universe, an exception being Rogue Squadron\'s Riv Shiel, but one is visible in the Mos Eisley cantina in A New Hope. This one, Lak Sivrak, was also at one stage a member of the Rebel Alliance, eventually dying when his X-Wing crash landed on the Forest Moon of Endor. His story is told in &quot;Tales From the Mos Eisley Cantina&quot; as &quot;One Last Night in the Mos Eisley Cantina&quot;, co-authored by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Jedi Master Voolvif Monn is an example of this species.',
  Sikan: 'The Sikans are an alien race native to the planet of Sika.',
  Sith: 'The Sith (also known as Red Sith during the time of the Old Sith Empire and Sith Purebloods during the time of the resurgent Sith Empire) were the native species of the planet Korriban. They had red skin and tentacle &quot;beards&quot;, and had a natural talent for mastering the Force as well as their magic and alchemy. Naturally cruel and manipulative, the Sith spread throughout the outer rim in the early days of the Old Republic, eventually centering their empire on Korriban. Some time after the Great Schism, several refugee Dark Jedi settled on the planet. Amazing the Sith with their mastery of the Force, the fallen Jedi soon elevated themselves to god-like status, becoming the rulers of the Sith. As the centuries passed, interbreeding occurred between the human Dark Jedi and the Sith, creating a half-species with an enormous talent for manipulating the Force. This species, which were also called Sith, had red skin like the original Sith. A prominent member of this half-species was the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos.&nbsp;\n\nThe name &quot;Sith&quot; was adopted by their Dark Jedi rulers, and has later been used by numerous fallen Jedi organizations. These new Sith are the primary antagonists in the Star Wars saga.&nbsp;\n\nThey are a playable race in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.&nbsp;\n\nThe extinct race Sith was the mortal enemy of the extinct race Jedi. According to the codex in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, both races drove each other to extinction, but not before spawning groups that copied and continued their ideals (the new &quot;Sith&quot; and the &quot;Jedi Knights&quot;). Naga Sadow was another pureblooded sith. His apprentice Freedon Nadd was Human.',
  Skakoan: 'The atmosphere in Skako is extremely dense, so Skakoans evolved to survive under great pressures.&lt;br/&gt;When a Skakoan leaves Skako, he/she decompresses and dies in any low-pressure environment. Thus, they wear special protective suits. Very few non-Skakoans have seen a Skakoan without the suit. The Skakoans were relatively unknown in the galaxy, except for their control of the Techno Union, an important union of engineers and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The most notable Skakoan is Wat Tambor, Foreman of the Techno Union.',
  Sneevel: 'A very scarce species, Sneevels are medium-sized creatures that have the nose of a pig, fangs, and a werewolf body. So far, Boles Roor is the only known Sneevel. Their home planet was known as Sneeve.',
  Snivvian: 'Coming from Cadomai Prime, Snivvians are short humanoids with protruding jaws and short fangs, sometimes called Snaggletooths (two versions of a Snivvian action figure dubbed Snaggletooth were produced for Kenner$S Star Wars action figure line in 1978, based on a Snivvian character seen in Mos Eisley$ Chalmun$ Cantina). Snivvians come from a cold world and have thick skin instead of fur. They are excellent scouts and trackers, and also obsessive artists. Frequently, a Snivvian author will research his or her characters to an extreme level, sometimes with great risk. When twin males are born, one of them is always a psychotic genius, so they try to control their genetics.&lt;br/&gt;They are a race similar in feature to Trandoshans and considered a sociopathic species.',
  Squib: 'A species from Skor II, Squibs are known for collecting knickknacks and for their love of trading/haggling.&lt;br/&gt;These fox-like creatures stand about a meter tall, with large, doe-like eyes and short fur ranging from red to blue in color. The Squibs evolved on Skor II, a world blessed with nearly limitless resources. These resources, however, were widely distributed across the planet. Consequently, the Squibs developed a sophisticated system of barter and trade as different Squib tribes exchanged goods with one another.&lt;br/&gt;Another interesting evolutionary trait is the Squib fur, which acts as a taste and smell receptor, enables a Squib to examine an object by touching it and rubbing it against his or her fur. Squibs are generally confident, gregarious, and annoyingly curious. They tend to run into a situation to examine virtually anything without any regard to possible danger to themselves. Their fast-paced metabolisms make them a bundle of energy, and they are often regarded as flighty by other beings.&lt;br/&gt;Their spaceships are built from recycled materials and utilize superior tractor beam technology to wield balls of refuse as both sword and shield.',
  Ssi$_Ruuk: 'The Ssi-Ruuk are a saurian race that invade from the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. This was around 4 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin), immediately following Return of the Jedi, in the novel The Truce at Bakura. Native to the planet Lwhekk, Ssi-Ruuk are warm-blooded, reptilian beings covered with scales of various colors. Their blunt, oversized heads end with beaked mouths, and their bodies end with muscular tails. They have clawed hands and feet, and strongly-muscled hind legs. Their skin is so thick that it can withstand blaster shots with only minor burns to show for it. They are blind to the Force, and communicate with each other via a complex series of tweets and whistles. They also have scent tongues which they eject from their nostrils. Each hand has three opposable claws. They all have three eyelids. As a rule, the Ssi-ruuk were highly xenophobic, but were more disgusted by other species than afraid of them. Their religion greatly fears death on any planet that has not been &quot;sanctified.&quot; As a result, they rely on a technology called entechment that involved capturing the life-energy of beings and using them as power sources. Entechment allows them to use unmanned spaceships for the majority of their combat.',
  Stereb: 'The Stereb were a race of primitive, red-skinned near-humans who once inhabited the world of Serocco. While they do not appear in any media, their story is told in detail in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. The Stereb possessed primitive technology and built many simple cities across their world. They co-existed with the human population of Serocco until their race was completely destroyed by the Mandalorians$ nuclear weapons during the Battle of Serocco.',
  Sullustan: 'A Sullustan is a native of the Sullust system. They are short, mouse-eared humanoids with large eyes and mouth-folds, known primarily as merchants and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;The Sullustans live in vast caves on the planet Sullust. Most Sullustans work for the Sorusuub Corporation. The majority of those that have found their way off-world work as starship crew. They have a reputation for excellence and intuition for piloting, which has mostly been earned through simple hard work, although as a race they possess perfect direction sense and memory thanks to spending their lives inside the pitch black caves and tunnels that run through Sullust. This allows them to remember any paths they have traveled, or maps they have seen, making them excellent navigators.&lt;br/&gt;In the Star Wars films, Sullustans make no appearance prior to Return of the Jedi (1983), where the most prominent member of the species seen on-screen, Nien Nunb, is Lando Calrissian$ co-pilot in the Millennium Falcon as it attacks the Death Star. A secondary Sullustan character was called Ten Nunb and was present at the briefing led by Mon Mothma, Admiral Ackbar, and General Madine, who was a B-wing pilot in the Rebel Alliance. He was killed by General Weir in the non-canonical comic series X-Wing: Rogue Leader published by Dark Horse Comics.&lt;br/&gt;According to the Star Wars Insider #67, p. 31, &quot;Ben Burtt used the real-world language Haya, a Kenyan dialect for Nunb$ Sullustan dialogue.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;In the Star Wars expanded universe, there is also the X-wing pilot Aril Nunb, a member of Rogue Squadron.&lt;br/&gt;Jae Juun is a freighter pilot, also from the Star Wars expanded universe. When first introduced (in The Joiner King), he pilots a Correllian freighter in the same class as the Millennium Falcon. His co-pilot is an Ewok named Tarfang. He later pilots the DR-909, and he and Tarfang help Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and their friends on their various exploits. The two of them run spinglass busts and sculptures for the Saras nest, and would have gotten into trouble with the Galactic Alliance government when it was discovered that these busts contained Gorog assassin bugs, had it not been for the intervention of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, who spoke to the Fifth Fleet admiral on their behalf, informing him of their innocence in the matter and their determination to right the wrong once it was discovered. Jae Juun and Tarfang are then employed as Intelligence agents by the Galactic Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;Sullustans are also a playable race in Star Wars Galaxies.',
  Talortai: 'The Talortai, a Force-sensitive sentient species from the planet Talor, had some avian and reptilian characteristics. Tyber Zann$s bodyguard Urai Fen was a member of the species.',
  Talpini: 'The Talpini are a species from world of Tal Pi. Their small size lets them conceal themselves easily among taller or bigger individuals. Weeteef Cyubee (played by Warwick Davis in Rogue One) was a member of this species.',
  Talz: 'The Talz are a furry race with two distinct sets of eyes: one for day vision, and one for night vision. They$re generally peaceful and pacifistic creatures, but were forced into slave labor by the Empire.&lt;citation_needed&gt;\nFoul Moudama was a Talz Jedi Knight who died protecting Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous.\nAnother notable Talz is Muftak from the book Tales From The Mos Eisley Cantina. In his story, he and a Chadra-Fan named Kabe pillage Jabba$s townhouse in Mos Eisley, but get caught and Muftak sacrifices himself for Kabe to escape and make a living with the money and jewels that they stole from Jabba$s house, but Kabe goes back to save him, and in the process the sack of money and jewels gets stolen.\nAnother notable Talz is Broonmark who served the Emperor$s Wrath in the Cold War.\nThey make an appearance in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the TV series.',
  Tarasin: 'Tarasin are chameleon-like species that can communicate silently by fluctuating skin color.',
  Taung: 'The Taung were early people of the capital planet of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant. They were the early ancestors of the Mando$a speaking Mandalorians. The Mandalorians inhabited Coruscant long before humans did. They battled the Zhell people (former humans) and the Mandalorians were driven out of the planet by a volcanic explosion which created a massive dust cloud. They also have a healing trait that far surpasses most other races, including ones like the Gen’dai and such, which they used to aid them in leading the Mandalorians off of their planet. Though most of the Mandalorians were thought to be driven out, some were rumored to have stayed behind and live amongst them.',
  Tauntaun: 'Tauntauns appear in The Empire Strikes Back as furry bipedal mounts the Rebels ride to patrol the planet Hoth in the vicinity of their hidden stronghold, Echo Base. Han Solo complained that tauntauns smelled bad, and that their innards smelled worse.\nOne appears in the center of this movie poster for the film.',
  Tchuukthai: 'The Tchuukthai, also called Wharls, are quadrupedal predators from an undiscovered planet. They are sentient, but most people in the galaxy consider them to be mere legendary beasts.&lt;citation_needed&gt; The secretive Tchuukthai do nothing to discourage this belief; if anything, they enhance it with their displays of ferocity. The Tchuukthai are unable to speak Galactic Basic, and very few are ever seen off their home planet. Jedi Master Thon was a Tchuukthai.',
  Teek: 'Teeks are rodentlike, simian creatures that live in the forest moon of Endor. They were first mentioned in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe book and one appeared in the movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. They have a reputation of scavenging and stealing from animal nests and Ewok dwellings.\nTeeks have long, pointed ears, scruffy white fur, and beady black eyes. They communicate by constant chattering. They wear clothes with many belts, pouches and pockets for the things they have managed to steal. They are also distinguished for running at stunning speed, almost moving too fast for the human eye to see.',
  Terentatek: 'Terentatek originally evolved on Korriban, where the power and presence of the dark side gradually distorted their shapes and corrupted their minds. Some sources, however, say that they were first created on Yavin 4 by Exar Kun, as one of his experiments in 3,997 BBY. It is possible that terentateks are highly altered rancors undergoing many experiments. Regardless, terentatek$s hide was immune to effects of the Force. They became the most dangerous of the creatures bred by the Sith. They were so powerful and dangerous to the Jedi, that they were often dubbed Jedi Killers.\nDuring an event known as the Great Hunt, numerous Jedi traveled throughout the galaxy to try to exterminate the terentatek. Jedi were often sent in groups of two or three to battle these beasts, and the Jedi of the group had a strong Force bond between them. This was done so that the group could strengthen itself from the dark influence prevalent in the lairs of the terentatek, and as it had to rely on its weaponry skills alone due to the almost complete Force immunity of the terentatek. None of the hunts were successful, however. Even though the Jedi seemingly exterminated a majority of the terentatek each time, the waxing of the dark side would trigger the terentatek to come out of hibernation and repopulate the galaxy. Such events included the rise to power of Revan, Malak, and Emperor Palpatine.\nTerentatek were also found on Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Onderon, Tython, and Yavin 4. During the Jedi Civil War, Revan and his companions found and killed a terentatek in Kashyyyk$s Shadowlands while searching for the Star Forge. It had been a ceremonial beast used in an old Wookiee ritual. In one such ritual many years ago, Bacca$s Ceremonial Blade had broken from its hilt and become embedded in the creature$s flesh when a headstrong Wookiee chieftain had attempted to slay it—the blade was recovered by Revan. Revan also single-handedly fought and killed two terentateks in the tomb of Naga Sadow. There was also a terentatek in the Shyrak Caves on Korriban, which turned out to be near the entrance to the tomb of Ludo Kressh.',
  Terrelian_Jango_Jumper: 'Terrelian Jango Jumpers are tall, slender humanoids from the planet Terrelia. Terrelians are an athletic species with high jumping capabilities and multicolored skin that could vary from gray to blue or white.

  Thrella: 'An extinct species from Mimban, mentioned in the novel Splinter of the Mind$s Eye. They were the builders of the Temple of Pomojema.',
  Timoliini: 'An extremely rare species from Mimban, this species lives in the southern swamps. Timoliini is known for its filthy eating habits and yellow-green skin. The species communicates by loud, high-pitched squeaks, sometimes as loud as 140 Decibels. Timoliinis live alone, are rarely seen in packs, and are highly anti-social. Little is known of the species. It has been speculated that a Timoliini can be seen in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, in the background in a Twilek$s cage.',
  Tirraclesians: 'Tirraclesians are a small race of humanoids who live on the planet Tirracles. As the planet Tirracles has two main continents, Tirraclesians generally identify themselves by which continent they were raised on: Tirracles-Kital and Tirracles-Nantor. Most Tirraclesians have light brown skin, dark red/brown/black hair, and brown/gold eyes. A small group of Tirraclesians also identify as Jensaari and a few manage to become Jedi.

  Togorian: 'Togorians are the felinoid inhabitants of Togoria. Most of them over two metres tall, the beings are covered with fur and have long slender muscles. They are described in A. C. Crispin&apos;s The Paradise Snare as very tall panther-like creatures. A Togorian male spends most of his time hunting, in pursuit of prey, they are known to use reptilian mosgoths as mounts. Once a year, male Togorians return to their city homes to mate. Female Togorians are famed for their technological proficiency. Male Togorians are often employed as pirates or bounty hunters due to their great size and power. Male Togorians will occasionally scatter crystal fragments in their thick fur, to dazzle their opponents.&lt;br&gt;Notable Togorians include Frrash, Muuurgh and Mrrov. Muuurgh met Han Solo while searching for his lost love among spice traders of Ylesia. At least one of the Vigos of the Black Sun criminal organization, killed by Darth Maul, was Togorian. The Togorians are known to have once been the barbaric pirates of the galaxy.&lt;br&gt;',
  Togruta: 'The Togruta are a species from the planet Shili.&lt;br&gt;They are a humanoid race distinguished by their three, and in rare cases four, lekku, or head tails (similar to those of Twi$lek) and hollow horn-like structures on their heads, known as montrals, which are integrated with their lekku. Their lekku also have a part of their brain in each one. Their montrals and lekku are striped to help them blend in with their natural surroundings. Skin colors of Togrutas are usually quite different from their striped montrals and lekku and range from red (most common), to orange, yellow, blue, and even white. Togruta possess a form of passive acoustic echolocation by means of their hollow montrals, which allows them to sense space and the proximity and movement of physical objects around them. Togruta work well in large groups, and individualism is seen as abnormal within their culture. They are also famous for their beauty.&lt;br&gt;Jedi Master Shaak Ti, Anakin Skywalker&apos;s Padawan Ahsoka Tano (The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, The Mandalorian, and Ahsoka), and Jedi Master Jora Malli (Light of the Jedi and Into the Dark) are Togruta. All the Jedi Togruta noted (so far) in the Star Wars universe are females.&lt;br&gt;',
  Toong: 'The Toong are a race of yellowish-skinned bipeds who sport large heads without a neck, gangly limbs and three antennae. They are timid and nervous by nature, and prefer to avoid confrontations. One notable Toong is the Podracer Ben Quadinaros.&lt;br&gt;',
  Toydarian: 'Toydaria is a swampy world in Hutt Space. The Toydarians are short, blue-skinned mammals, with generally fat bodies and trunk-like snouts. Their stomachs are full of light gases, allowing them to fly when flapping their leathery wings.&lt;br&gt;They have trunks on their faces that rest above their short tusks. A Toydarian&apos;s thin legs end in webbed feet and the males of the species usually show sparse whiskers on their chin and throat, giving them an unshaven appearance. They are immune to every mind trick caused by the Force (As stated by Watto: "I&apos;m a Toydarian! Mind tricks don&apos;t work on me—only money!"). Watto, a slaver who owned Anakin Skywalker, is a Toydarian, as is Reti, a starfighter pilot in the Starfighter series of games. Air traffic is strictly regulated on Toydaria as the Toydarians all fly around the planet and rarely use vehicles. There are trains on the planet for other travelers.&lt;br&gt;',
  Trandoshan: 'Trandoshan are large, carnivorous, reptilian humanoids from the planet Trandosha (or Dosha), they have supersensitive eyes that can see into the infrared range and the ability to regenerate lost limbs. They are also able to shed their skin.&lt;br&gt;The Trandoshans are a warlike species who allied early with the Empire and the Confederacy during the Clone Wars, taking Wookiees as slaves. They are the natural enemies of Wookiees, and both Wookiees and Trandoshans keep each other&apos;s dried skins and pelts as prizes.&lt;br&gt;As of the original Star Wars races book, their world of origin (Trandoshan or Dosha) occupies the same stellar system as Kashyyyk (the Wookiee homeworld), and it is this proximity that is the source of much of their enmity for the Wookiee race. Unconfirmed speculation suggests that the short-lived Trandoshani overcame their natural limitations as tool users and their harsh homeworld environment to achieve limited space flight on their own, only to discover that the only other inhabited world in their system was a lush, verdant, prey-rich paradise filled with long-lived and technologically unsophisticated savages, and that they&apos;ve never quite gotten over their pique.&lt;br&gt;Trandoshan religion consists mainly of trying to score enough Jagannath points (The name appears to derive from Jagannath, a deity from Vaishnavism)&lt;br&gt;earned through bounty-hunting or slavery-based kills, to appease the main goddess, or Scorekeeper. Thus, many Trandoshans are bounty hunters or slavers, operating both inside and outside the boundaries of the law. They take particular pleasure in skinning Wookiees for their pelts.&lt;br&gt;A notable Trandoshan is Bossk, who had a cameo role in the movies and is a longtime enemy of both Han Solo and Chewbacca the Wookiee.&lt;br&gt;The race was playable in Star Wars Galaxies, but were unable to wear most footwear or gloves. They also feature in the computer game Republic Commando, where a force of Trandoshan mercenaries take over a Republic ship, and in the Knights of the Old Republic series (particularly in II, where on the world of Nar Shaddaa an elderly Trandoshan can be conversed with for an extended philosophical debate). Bossk is also a playable character in the Real Time Strategy game Star Wars: Empire at War as part of the Forces of Corruption expansion pack. In Star Wars: The Old Republic, Qyzen Fess is an attainable Trandoshan companion character.&lt;br&gt;Two examples of Trandoshans are Dar and his father and the leader of the Trandoshans, Garnac.&lt;br&gt;',
  Trianii: 'An advanced, adventurous feline species, the Trianii inhabit the outermost portion of the Corporate Sector Authority.&lt;br&gt;In many ways they are similar to the Togorians, Cathar, and Catuman Warriors. Unlike these other feline species, however, Trianii have prehensile tails and their more agile figures are perfect for leaping, jumping, and acrobatics. Like most feline species Trianii have excellent balance and eyesight. Their sleek fur comes in a wide range of colors and patterns. Trian, the Trianii home planet, and its six colony worlds were the target of an attempted annexation by the Corporate Sector Authority. This annexation was repelled by the Trianii and their renowned Rangers and the Trianii remained independent and unhindered throughout the rise and fall of the Empire.&lt;br&gt;',
  Ubese: 'Ubese are humanoid creatures that are primarily called on as mercenaries or bounty hunters. Normally, they are very aggressive people. The Ubese$s home world is unknown, and was supposedly heavily bombarded by Republic warships in ancient times. The Republic attacked in a preemptive strike due to aggressive weapon development programs on Ubese worlds. The bombardments destroyed the weapon stockpiles, destroying Uba I outright and poisoning Uba II, Uba III and Uba V. Only Uba IV remained somewhat viable, although the toxic atmosphere requires that the Ubese wear environment suits outdoors. Ubese tend to be very secretive, associating only within their own circles.\n\nThey have a very distinct hatred for Jedi, believing they destroyed their homeworld; thus they train with Cortosis weapons, items that can resist lightsabers. During the events of Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, they were employed by an Exchange thug to kill the Jedi Exile. The typical Ubese wears a protective, airtight environment suit, and it$s usually armed with a double bladed vibrosword. The armor they wear In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is black with a little shine, their faces are not visible due to the helmets they prefer to wear.\n\nPrincess Leia was disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh in the beginning of Return of the Jedi.\n\nUbese language is simply called Ubese.',

Raynar eventually became UnuThul, leader of the Killiks (name from the hive$s name, $Unu$ and Raynar$s last name, $Thul$). Any part of the old Raynar Thul$s mind was either destroyed or buried in his own mind. The Unu and Killiks are introduced in The Dark Nest trilogy by Troy Denning, part of the Star Wars Expanded Universe.',
  Utai: 'The Utai are one of the two races native to the planet Utapau. They have long eyestalks, a short body structure, two toes per foot, four fingers per hand, and brown eyes that are well adapted to dark conditions. The Utai are also known as Shorts, due to both their short stature and brief lives. They are native to the sinkholes of their home planet, being the first to colonize the walls and crevices. They are primarily working-class people, responsible for large aquaculture plots and domesticating several creatures for use as transports and beasts of burden&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;.\n\nUtai society exists side by side with that of the gaunt Pau\'an. They have only been seen in Star Wars: Episode III &ndash; Revenge of the Sith. Where the Pau\'ans are tall and thin, their Utai cousins are generally short and chubby. Utai have pale, hairless skin and large, oblong heads. Two glassy black eyes protrude on thick stalks from the Utai$s face, which is otherwise unremarkable, aside from a small, puckered mouth. Utai have stubby, four-fingered hands and are capable workers and mechanics. An age ago, the Utai were the sole inhabitants of Utapau$s plummeting sinkholes, living in dwellings nestled among the crevices of the rocky walls. A planetary climate change forced Utapau$s other primary species, the Pau\'ans, to migrate underground. The two species formed a mutually beneficial society, merging their disparate civilizations and generally living in peace. A natural hierarchy formed, with the Pau\'ans well placed as the rulers and politicians of the Utapaun cities, while the more hands-on Utai served as laborers and workers.',
  Utapaun: 'The native inhabitants of Utapau can be divided into two distinct species. The taller, more highly evolved Pau$ans have deeply lined, ash-colored faces, gaunt builds, and wear thick, tightly fitting clothes. The smaller Utai make up the working class. They have rounded faces with distended eyes, and have a short, stocky build.',
  Vaathkree: 'This species evolved on the planet of Vaathkree. They seem to be made of stone and metal, but it is only an armor-like covering. They are known for their religion, centered on bartering.',
  Vagaari: 'The Vagaari are a humanoid species from the Unknown Regions. They are a race of nomadic conquerors and slavers that ruled a considerable area in the Unknown Regions. They are led by the Miskara, a position obtained after successfully executing a coup d$etat. Their clothing includes voluminous robes and large Vagaari traditional masks intended to compensate for their height and scare enemies. Their government was the Vagaari Empire. They appear in Outbound Flight and Survivor$s Quest, and are mentioned significantly in the Ascendancy Trilogy.',
  Veknoid: 'Veknoids, also known as Velkoids, were a species native to the planet Moonus Mandel. The famous podracer Teemto Pagalies was a Veknoid, as was the Jedi Master Zao.',
  Vella: 'Vella are the amphibious humanoid inhabitants of the planet Velreone.',
  Verpine: 'The Verpine inhabit the Roche asteroid field and run the aerospace engineering company Slayn & Korpil. Verpine are characterized by their bipedal, wingless bodies and their unusual ability to communicate with each other via organic short l-wave radio transmissions originating from their antenna. They also have vision which enables them to view microscopic fractures and stresses, which is one of the reasons they make excellent mechanic and repair crews. With Admiral Ackbar, they designed the B-wing. They have an egalitarian, completely democratized society. Until recently, the Verpine do not play a significant part in any of the Star Wars movies or novels, but several of their devices do appear in the video game series Knights of the Old Republic as well as in Star Wars novels. These devices seem to be almost exclusively weaponry or arms-related and include a wide array of hand-held projectiles that can alternatively function as shotguns, sniper rifles, high-power assault rifles and fully automatic machine guns.\n\nHowever, in Karen Traviss$ book Sacrifice, they approached Boba Fett with offers of a protection agreement, wherein Verpine technology would be combined with Mandalorian iron to produce unmatched weaponry. Fett agrees, and through the book it is apparent that as opposed to being equals, the Verpine fall more under a Mandalorian sphere of influence. The Verpine initiate the terms of the treaty when an argument with the Murkhanan over patents is ignored by the New Republic. Jacen Solo ordered part of a fleet to patrol the space between planets, arguably to get a look at the new Mandalorian fighter, the Bes$uliik, and also setting up a possible Mandalorian/Republic conflict. The book ends with Boba Fett leading a strike force of Bes$ulikks to bomb a series of Murkhanan industrial areas, and to announce that the Mandalorians have returned.',
  Vodran: 'The Vodrans are a species of 1.8-meter-tall humanoid reptiles, with tough skin ranging in coloration from olive to brown, and a small frame of spiny horns around their faces. Though warm-blooded, they laid reptilian eggs, with an egg clutch typically producing two or three Vodran young. They were native to the planet Vodran on the fringes of the Si$klaata Cluster.\n\nBefore the founding of the Galactic Republic, the Vodrans were approached by Dojundo the Hutt, an emissary from the Hutt Empire, to recruit the Vodrans for the Hutts$ war with the legendary Xim the Despot. The Vodrans, believing the Hutts to be evil deities, agreed to serve the Hutts. Their presence, along with those of the Weequay, Klatooinians and Nikto, was instrumental in the defeat of Xim$s army of war droids at the Third Battle of Vontor. After the victory at Vontor, the Hutts had the Vodran representative, Kl$ieutu Mutela, along with the representatives of the Klatooinans, Weequay and Nikto, sign themselves into $eternal$ servitude, which the Vodran fulfilled faithfully.\n\nIn time, Vodrans adopted Hutt culture as their own. Their society was organized into miniature kajidics, and their family clans answered directly to the Hutt Clan of Ancients. Their dealings with the rest of the galaxy always went through their Hutt masters.',

  Voxyn: 'The Voxyn are a reptilian species known for their ferocious defense mechanisms. As well as being extremely agile, they bear poisonous spinal bristles, spit a strong acid (brown in color), and have a screech noted to cause bleeding of the ears in some of the humanoid characters. These vicious creatures were created by the Yuuzhan Vong during the $New Jedi Order$ time period to hunt and kill Jedi.

All other appearances of the species in other franchise publications are as mentions.',
  Vratix: 'The Vratix are native to the planet of Thyferra. They are essential in the creation of the healing fluid bacta. They perfected the creation of bacta by combining alazhi and kavam. They vastly outnumber the human natives of the planet, but are considered inferior to their corporate counterparts.\n\nThe Vratix are humanoid insects. They have large, compound eyes, a stalk-like neck, and three pairs of limbs sprouting from a cylindrical thorax and abdomen. The upper set of limbs acts as triple-jointed arms, while the lower two serve as legs. The last set of limbs is well muscled, and is used in jumping. Most Vratix are gray in color, with the shades darkening with age.',
  Vulptereen: 'Vulptereen are a stocky race from Vulpter, recognizable by their shovel-like snouts which sported six tusks and a single long feeler.',
  Vurk: 'Vurks are a reptilian humanoid species, with elongated faces, dark eyes, and a sweeping crest extending from their skulls, giving them the appearance of a parasaurolophus. They are native to the remote planet Sembla, a watery world with warm shallow seas, small volcanic islands, and beautiful coral reefs rich in crystals.\n\nVurks are nomadic and they are equally comfortable on both land and water. Though they are very ethical and peaceful they are wrongly considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy because they have not developed large settlements and technology. This, however, is due to not needing them and not because of low intelligence level.\n\nJedi Master Coleman Trebor was a Vurk.',
  Weequay: 'They are a race of humanoid creatures that hail from the planet Sriluur, a harsh desert planet lending to the species$ tanned skin tone and rough, sandy, wrinkled skin.

  Wharl: 'Wharls are another name for the Tchuukthai.',
  Whiphid: 'Whiphids (also known as Toolans) are tall, muscled, furred creatures with great tusks from the planet Toola. They are great hunters and they export ice to other planets. They can also go into a coma-like state to heal major wounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One particular Whiphid was J$Quille, who, while working under Jabba the Hutt, had tried to assassinate him with a slow-acting poison in his food.&amp;#91;4&amp;#93; Another Whiphid was Jedi Master K$Kruhk. He supposedly died at the Battle of Hypori, though he was shown to be alive approximately 150 years later.&amp;#91;5&amp;#93; Aiaks Fwa was a Whiphid bounty hunter employed by Jabba the Hutt for services pertaining to the Battle of Ylesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many Whiphids can be found as thugs and enforcers in the underworld—a sizable chunk of the thuggish workers in the aggressive, regulation-smashing Offworld Mining Corporation were Whiphids, and the crime boss Lady Valarian operating off of Tatooine, a one-time competitor with Jabba the Hutt, was also a Whiphid—as they are disliked by most other races in general for some of their crude and brutish tendencies. &amp;#91;citation needed&amp;#93;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The home planet of the Whiphids is the icy world of Toola in the Outer Rim. Clone Commander Keller led an Imperial task force to root out Jedi hiding on Toola in the early days of the New Order. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, found Jedi artifacts left behind by a Master of the Old Jedi Order in a cave there—possibly the work of Keller$ division, although Skywalker observed lightsaber slashes in the Jedi$ empty robes that he believed must have been the handiwork of his father, Darth Vader.&amp;#91;6&amp;#93;',
  Wirutid: 'A Wirutid is a hyper-intelligent fungus that evolves into a human form to secure shelter and trap prey.&amp;#91;citation needed&amp;#93;',
  Wol_Cabasshite: 'A commonly misunderstood and mis characterized species, Wol Cabasshites are a unique example of a culture that has advanced to sentience without the need for technology. Their evolved brains are indeed highly intelligent, but with a life cycle so abstract and alien, their musings are often indecipherable. Indeed, studying Wol Cabasshite$ philosophy has long been a fashionable pastime of the intellectual elite, with longstanding debates regarding interpretation of the most famous and bizarre of Wol Cabasshite texts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The closest known genetic relative of the very long-lived Wol Cabasshites is a small, non-sentient species of plasma leech parasite whose entire life-cycle occurs on spacecraft where they feed on plasma and other energetic power sources. Millennia of space travel have spread both the non-sentient leech and the Wol Cabasshite throughout the galaxy, far from their homeworld of Wol Cabassh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wol Cabasshites are remarkably hardy. They can exist in both vacuum and atmosphere, having no respiratory system and a naturally pressurized interior. Wol Cabasshites can tolerate remarkable temperature extremes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a plasma-rich diet and extraordinarily high metallic content in their blood, Wol Cabasshites exude a magnetic field controlled by certain internal muscles, including their tongues. By shaping and focusing this field, Cabasshites communicate with each other at a range of up to 25 meters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their language uses phonemic pulses of energy with syntactic contours in the field. Magnetic singing is an important part of Wol Cabasshite cultures. Gifted Wol Cabasshites can use magnetic fields to communicate directly with the neurons of other sentients, though this often requires direct contact. The sometimes unsettling sensation of direct neuron communication with a Wol Cabasshite has spread to rumors that the species can take control of a subject$ brain, though that is not the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wol Cabasshite ability to manipulate magnetic fields has resulted in the development of devices by other cultures to assist in communication. Wol Cabasshites can operate devices attuned to their magnetic singing for the purposes of locomotion, communication and even defense, though most do not bother. Most Wol Cabasshites are content to simply sit and contemplate the nature of the universe... and eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physiologically, Wol Cabasshites are mostly stomach; they even have two brains, one for digestive tasks and one for cognition. They eat constantly, extracting nutrients and metals from nearly any substance they touch. There are no known substances that are toxic to Wol Cabasshites, though they are susceptible to Brainworm Rot Type A, an airborne virus that affects their cognitive functions. Given the bizarre nature of Wol Cabasshite thought, diagnosis is very difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Wol Cabasshites reproduce asexually by vomiting out their stomach linings (which become pupal Cabasshite), adults may exchange genetic material during mutual tongue grooming. This results in organisms exhibiting isolated genetic properties of other individuals.',
  Wookiee: 'Wookiees are generally peaceful creatures of the forests of Kashyyyk. They have a tribal society governed by a Chieftain. They are very tall, furry and powerful with a humanoid shape. They have extremely sharp rectractable claws; however, it is considered a Tribal crime to use claws in combat. Aside from their stature Wookiee have bow casters which can also be seen with mounted scopes. They are considered loyal friends, and commit life debts to people who save them—the most well known being the life debt between Chewbacca and Han Solo.',
  Woostoid: 'Yellow-skinned humanoids from the planet Woostri. They were targeted during Grand Admiral Thrawn&apos;s campaign of galactic conquest. Surprisingly, these aliens held Imperial doctrines as truth. In the novel The Last Command, these aliens were referred to as the Woostroid.',
  Wroonian: 'Wroonians are a blue-skinned humanoid race from the planet Wroona in the Inner Rim.',

  Xendekian: 'The Xendekian are a small species of blue, brown, green, and reddish-brown colored skin native to the planet of Xendek. They first appeared in the comic strip called &quot;Endangered, Part 1&quot; in the lead story of Star Wars Adventures 7.',
  Xexto: 'The Xexto are short, (1.30 m [4&apos;3&quot;] max), have four arms, two legs and long necks. They hail from the planet Troiken. Some prominent Xexto include Gasgano, the Podracer pilot; and Yarael Poof, Jedi Master and one of the last members of the Jedi Council before the Great Jedi Purge, who was a member of a genetically altered sect of Xexto, the Quermians.',
  Y$bith: 'Millions of years ago, sentience took root among the ancient forerunners of the Bith species on Clak&apos;Dor VII. As the Bith evolved, they developed impressive cities in the mountains and jungles of their world. The capital city of Weogar and the domed city of Nozho stood for centuries as testament to the achievement of the proto-Bith culture, but relations between the cities soured, and they developed a fierce rivalry. About three hundred years ago, the tensions boiled over as a dispute over a stardrive patent ignited in a civil war. When the war finally ended, Clak&apos;dor VII&apos;s biosphere was ruined. A biological attack launched at Nozho had shattered the city, mutating its populace, and the surrounding wildlife.\n\nMost Nozho citizens were killed outright, but many who survived developed mutagenic irregularities that soon led to the creation of a subspecies of Bith. The Y&apos;bith—which translates as &quot;Ghost Bith,&quot; eventually left the hermetically sealed cities that were built amid the ruins, and attempted to establish a permanent population on Clak&apos;dor IV, where they eventually founded the city of New Nozho.\n\nThe bio-engineering geniuses among the Y&apos;bith stabilized much of the mutation&apos;s worst effects, but the populace had to adapt to their new traits of poor eyesight, stronger hands and feet, ductile mouth structures, sensitive skin and thicker bones. The Y&apos;bith have been tolerated by the Bith, though not openly accepted by mainstream Bith culture. Though some claim residual guilt over the bombings that created the Y&apos;bith as the cause of Bith apprehension, the Bith themselves pragmatically deny such reasons. They cite the Y&apos;bith&apos;s volatile biochemistry that triggers bouts of violence and aggression as reason enough to keep their distance.\n\nThe Y&apos;bith have been working to gain acceptance as members of the galactic community, with New Nozho becoming a notable trade port. Over the course of generations, the Y&apos;bith had spread to other worlds, forming a notable minority presence on Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant, where they aided the rebuilding efforts following the Yuuzhan Vong war.\n\nThe Y&apos;bith see the story of their people as one of success, and will continue working tirelessly until the whole galaxy, including their Bith cousins, agree.',
  Yevetha: 'Yevetha are a Star Wars legends species now extinct or severely endangered skeletal-looking race of humanoids from the planet N&apos;zoth, near the Galactic Core.\n\nThey were extremely xenophobic, considering all other races to be vermin. The Empire utilized them as shipyard workers and technicians during the Galactic Civil War, primarily because of their perfectionist nature and knack for technology. This backfired when the Yevetha took over all the Black 15 shipyards and killed or enslaved all the Imperials during a full retreat. During the events of the New Jedi Order, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked and destroyed the Yevetha at the behest of the Fia, a race from the Koornacht Cluster world of Galantos. So great was the Yevethan disdain for other species that one of the survivors chose to attack and destroy a Chiss clawcraft rather than accept aid.\n\nAn Imperial officer once commented to Princess Leia that the Empire had always feared the potential of the Yevetha, noting that they were never allowed access to sensitive technology like hyperdrives.\n\nAt their peak, the Yevetha controlled a vast fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers, Interdictor Cruisers, their own custom-made thrustships, and the Super Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha.',
  Yoda$s_species: 'An unnamed race of diminutive green-skinned humanoids with large pointed ears. Some are powerful with the Force. Known members include Yoda (introduced in The Empire Strikes Back), Yaddle (first seen in Episode I – The Phantom Menace), Vandar Tokare (Knights of the Old Republic) and Grogu (also known as &quot;the Child&quot; or &quot;Baby Yoda&quot;) of The Mandalorian. They can live for many centuries, as Yoda claims to be 900 years old.&quot; Much about the species, including its name and origins, has been deliberately left vague by George Lucas and other Star Wars writers.',
  Yuuzhan_Vong$_Grysk: 'The Yuuzhan Vong were introduced as the main antagonists of the book series The New Jedi Order (1999&ndash;2003) depicted as an extragalactic, technophobic, fanatically religious species who were intent upon conquering the galaxy, which they attempted during the Yuuzhan Vong War. They were both invisible to direct Force sight and unaffected by direct Force powers. The Yuuzhan Vong used biotechnology and their culture was based on dominating, eradicating, or enslaving others, and body mutilation for social status.&amp;#91;11&amp;#93;\n\nThe species was said to have featured peripherally in canceled episodes of The Clone Wars.&amp;#91;12&amp;#93;\n\nThe invasion is coming, Lord Vader. But I have now bought the Empire time to prepare.\n\n&mdash;Grand Admiral Thrawn, to Darth Vader&amp;#91;13&amp;#93;',
  Canon: 'After the October 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the Yuuzhan Vong were declared non-canonical in April 2014. In their stead, The Force Awakens (2015) introduced the First Order, a successor state that arose from one of many Imperial Remnants between 5 and 21 ABY, and eventually destroyed the New Republic in 34 ABY, while the Resistance (formed in 28 ABY) continued to fight against the First Order. A canonical version of the Yuuzhan Vong, now known as the Grysk, was introduced in the Timothy Zahn novel Thrawn: Alliances (2018). Both species are described as having sloping foreheads and skull-like faces, as well as being a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy hailing from the Unknown Regions and enslaving other races, though the Grysk use conventional mechanical technology rather than biotechnology, and the novel is set in an earlier time frame than the previous non-canonical Legends novels. The Grysk made a major appearance&mdash;as Jixtus&mdash;in Thrawn: The Ascendancy Trilogy.',
  Yuvernian: 'The Yuvernians are a two-headed, mottled-skinned, reptilian horselike race from the planet of Yuvern. They were fairly large beings, 4.8 meters in length, and standing 2.4 meters in height. They had yellow skin with black spots and elongated skulls. A Yuvernian named Cane Adiss can be seen in Jabba&apos;s palace in Return of the Jedi.',
  Yuzzem: 'The Yuzzem are a large powerful mammalian species similar to Wookiees. Most were enslaved during the reign of the Empire and taken from their home planet of Ragna III to do hard labor. They appear similar to Wookiees, but appearing more like werewolves. Their similarities to Wookiees have led people to believe the two share a common ancestor, but this has not been confirmed.',
  Yuzzum: 'The Yuzzums (not to be confused with Yuzzem) are fur-covered mammals with a wide mouth with protruding teeth on top of their heads and long legs. They are less intelligent than the Ewoks and dwell on the plains of the forest moon Endor. Groups of Yuzzums often hunt in packs through the tall grass of the plains hunting for rodents to eat.\n\nThey have been exported as pets, but are not very good at it. They have a musical language and some Yuzzums have found employment as singers.&amp;#91;14&amp;#93; One of the singers in Jabba the Hutt&apos;s court was a Yuzzum named Joh Yowza. Only three Yuzzums have been seen so far: Joh Yowza, Schmood, and Wam Lufba. Joh Yowza is the only CGI Yuzzum, the rest are puppets.',
  Zabrak: 'The Zabrak are humanoids whose most distinctive feature is the array of small horns on top of their heads. Their home planet is Iridonia, though they have a subspecies hailing from the planet of Dathomir. It is believed that they are among the galaxy&apos;s first space-faring people. They have strong willpower and are a stubborn, proud people. By nature, they tend to be independent and fearless, hence have never been a successful venture in the slave trade. One commonly recognized individual of this race is Darth Maul, Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Their crown of horns typically grow in at puberty, and are considered secondary sex characteristics. The pattern in which horns grow differs between Zabrak sub-species. It is analogous to race/subspecies.\n\nZabrak eye colors are often similar to the eye colors of humans, with blues and browns being the most common. Yellow, purple, red, green, and orange eyes are also seen regularly. However, Darth Maul&apos;s red-yellow eye color was apparently the result of corruption by the Dark Side. Zabrak also traditionally have facial tattoos, typically composed of a pattern of thin lines, which is considered the most traditional of Zabrak tattoos.\n\nZabrak are popular in the gaming world. The customizable player character of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Jaden Korr, can be a Zabrak female. Players of the MMO Star Wars: Galaxies were able to choose Zabrak as a playable race, and can currently do so in the Star Wars MMO, Star Wars: The Old Republic. In Star Wars: Battlefront II, Iridonian and Dathomirian Zabraks were both choosable classes for heavy and specialist.',
  Iridonian: 'Iridonian Zabrak skin coloration could be light tan, light, tan, dark, brown, or even moonlight blue. Zabraks could be completely bald or fully haired. Certain horn patterns are linked with certain hair patterns or lack thereof. Hair can be any of the same colors seen in the human species. However, unlike humans, Zabrak males do not have eyebrows and do not grow facial hair. There is also a different pattern of horns for each gender. The horns on the female are more directed to the front of the head, while the most commonly males have them spanned all across the top of their head.\n\nIridonians kept their tattoos more conservative than Dathomirians. Zabrak are also well known for their skill with technology and highly advanced weaponry.\n\nKnown Iridonian Zabrak from canon include Agen Kolar, Eeth Koth, and Sugi (The Clone Wars). Known Iridonian Zabrak from the Star Wars expanded universe include Bao-Dur (Knights of the Old Republic II), Maris Brood (Star Wars: The Force Unleashed), and Wolf Sazen (Star Wars: Legacy).',
  Dathomirian: 'Dathomirian Zabrak skin coloration for males could be red, peach, or yellow. Females could have white, blue, or gray skin. Only males had horns, females didn&apos;t. Male Dathomirian Zabraks did not have hair unlike Iridonians, but females could.\n\nDathomirian tattoos were quite elaborate, and were applied to them at a young age. Tattoos could be black or brown and were created using the paste of the mushling plant from their home planet of Dathomir.\n\nMale Dathomirians referred to each other as brothers. They were skilled in melee and hand-to-hand combat and known for their tribal and savage ways.\n\nFemale Dathomirians referred to each other as sisters and lived in clans with each practicing the dark side of the force which they called, &quot;magick&quot;. They&apos;re also the more dominant gender.\n\nKnown Dathomirian Zabrak from canon and the expanded universe include Darth Maul, Savage Opress and Asajj Ventress (The Clone Wars).',
  Zeffo: 'The Zeffo, also known as the Zeffonians, are an extinct race of anthropomorphic force-sensitive beings. From the planet of the same name, the Zeffo is introduced in the video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which was developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. The Zeffo were ruled by Sages, and tombs were built to remember them. The Zeffo valued the Force, and are often credited as &quot;the first of the force-sensitive.&quot;&amp;#91;15&amp;#93; The exact reason for the extinction of the Zeffo is unknown, but in a recording left behind by an unknown Zeffo Sage, he states that his people were &quot;learning the ways of pride and greed.&quot;&amp;#91;16&amp;#93;\n\nThe Zeffo homeworld has a rocky and mountainous structure, similar to the structure of Earth. After the extinction of the Zeffo species, Imperial forces occupy the planet. An Imperial excavation can be found on Zeffo, as well as a crashed Venator near an ancient tomb.&amp;#91;17&amp;#93;',
  Zeltron: 'The extremely attractive Zeltrons are a near-human species native to the planet Zeltros. Their skin is bright pink, full red to dark brown, a special pigmentation that develops from a reaction to their sun&apos;s radiation. The Zeltron people have the ability to project powerful pheromones, much like those emitted by Falleen. These can be activated at will and can affect a specific individual or entire groups at the same time.\n\nZeltrons are also empathic, able to sense the feelings of others as well as project their own. For this reason their love and comfort is extremely important to them. Sharing positive emotions is deemed to everyone&apos;s benefit, while sharing negative emotions is not. In accordance with this, Zeltros&apos; democratic government will go to great lengths to make sure no one on Zeltros is unhappy. Zeltros has had few tyrants or despotic rulers, because they cannot commit atrocities without experiencing another&apos;s pain. Zeltros has, however, been invaded twelve times in the past six centuries. But most invaders, because of the Zeltrons&apos; pheromones, have given up their hostile intentions and joined in the non-stop festivities. Hence, Zeltrons do not worry about such trivial matters as planetary defenses or military forces. They are able fighters, though, and they stay in peak physical condition at all times.\n\nZeltrons will go to any length to please guests, and they get pleasure from being hospitable. They hold massive celebrations for practically any event. They are also extremely promiscuous, and are extremely proud of their sexual prowess. They consider the concept of monogamy quaint, but unrealistic.\n\nZeltron technology is on par with most space-faring worlds. They possess space travel, advanced agricultural and industrial methods, and excellent knowledge of medicine, particularly antibiotics. Zeltron scientists have provided notable refinements in the fields of science, and created much of the technology for the Pleasure Domes at Hologram Fun World.\n\nZeltron craftsmen are renowned the galaxy over for their erotic sculptures, paintings, and other works of art. Also in high demand on other worlds are Zeltron courtesans, known as criblez, who fulfill any physical desire one may have, without limits. Many crime lords, particularly Hutts, have taken special interest in these Zeltron servants. Because of their popularity, and because they spend their lives pursuing gratification, Zeltrons are quite common in the galaxy, particularly at spaceports, where they can find many prospective mates.',
  Zhell: 'The Zhell are the supposed pre-evolved state of humans in the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nThe Zhell were dominant on Coruscant at some point before 25,000 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) until the Taung conquered them. In the middle of their epic battle against the Zhell, their efforts were helped by an erupting volcano that wiped out the major Zhell city. The Taung then systematically destroyed all remaining Zhell camps.',
  Zillo_Beast: 'The Zillo Beast was a gargantuan serpentine creature with a lengthy, whip-like tail. At 97 meters tall, the Zillo Beast towered over all species on its native planet of Malastare and was considered at the top of its food chain until its presumed extinction. Its tail contained eight sharp spikes, and the beast itself uniquely possessed a third arm protruding from its back.\n\nIts heavy plated armor was invulnerable to explosions, blaster fire, and even lightsaber strikes. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker discovered that gaps in the creature&apos;s armored plates could be exploited to damage or stun the creature. On one such occasion, clone troopers were able to subdue the creature by using stun tanks aimed at the gaps in its armor to put the beast to sleep for transport to Coruscant.\n\nThis creature first appeared in The Clone Wars season 2, episode 18, &quot;The Zillo Beast&quot;.',
  Zygerrian: 'The Zygerrians are a race of feline-like bipeds, who are slavers from the planet Zygerria which is governed by queen Miraj Scintel. They appear on The Clone Wars during the &quot;Slaves of the Republic&quot; arc.',
